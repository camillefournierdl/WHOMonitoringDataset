```{r load WHO data}

```

```{r match with spatial- UC dataset}
library(terra)
library(terra)

spatUC <- vect("dataSecondary/UC_fixed_geom.gpkg")

plot(spatUC) # to visualize what this contains

dfUC <- as.data.frame(spatUC) # now this is a simple df

# essentially the idea would be to match this dfUC data (I use the ID in all city-level analysis) from the name (UC_NM_MN first and maybe explore UC_NM_LST)
# to the first year of presence of a air pollution measurement in the WHO dataset (consolidated city name)
# maybe an approach using the country as a first filter before matching is a good solution here too.
