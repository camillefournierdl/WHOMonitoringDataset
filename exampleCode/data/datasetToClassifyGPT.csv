0,10.3390/ijerph20054144,A Comparison of the Effect of Facemasks on Perceived Breathability and Air Quality during Daily Activities and Indoor Exercises,Qin L.-Y.,2023,,20.0,5,"Transmission of COVID-19 occurs predominantly through respired droplets and aerosols containing the SARS-CoV-2 virus. As a solution, face masks have been used to protect against infection. Wearing face masks during indoor exercises is essential to prevent the spread of virus-containing respiratory droplets and aerosols. However, previous studies have not investigated all elements, including the users’ perceived breathability (PB) and perceived air quality (PAQ) when wearing a face mask during indoor exercises. The current study aimed to assess users’ perceived comfort (PC) of face masks based on assessment criteria of PB and PAQ during moderate to vigorous exercises, and compare them with those during normal daily activities. Data on PC, PB, and PAQ were collected from an online questionnaire survey from 104 participants doing regular moderate to vigorous exercises. Within-subjects comparison with self-controlled case series design was performed to compare PC, PB, and PAQ between wearing face masks during exercises and daily activities. Results showed that the degree of dissatisfaction with PC, PB, and PAQ while wearing face masks and performing indoor exercises is higher than when performing daily activities (p < 0.05). The significance of the study implies that masks comfortable for daily activities may not remain the same during moderate to vigorous exercises, especially during indoor exercises. © 2023 by the author.",airborne transmission; COVID-19 pandemic; face mask; indoor exercises; perceived air quality; perceived breathability; perceived comfort; self-controlled case series,Air Pollution; COVID-19; Humans; Masks; Respiratory Aerosols and Droplets; SARS-CoV-2; air quality; comparative study; COVID-19; disease transmission; physical activity; questionnaire survey; adult; air quality; Article; badminton; basketball; bowling; breathing; case study; comfort; controlled study; cycling; daily life activity; exercise; exercise intensity; female; human; male; questionnaire; satisfaction; treadmill exercise; yoga; air pollution; mask,,Scopus,"A Comparison of the Effect of Facemasks on Perceived Breathability and Air Quality during Daily Activities and Indoor Exercises Transmission of COVID-19 occurs predominantly through respired droplets and aerosols containing the SARS-CoV-2 virus.

2,10.3390/app11041894,A New Indicator to Assess Public Perception of Air Pollution Based on Complaint Data,"Sun, Y; Jin, FX; Zheng, Y; Ji, M; Wang, HM",2021,APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL,11,4,"Severe air pollution problems have led to a rise in the Chinese public's concern, and it is necessary to use monitoring stations to monitor and evaluate pollutant levels. However, monitoring stations are limited, and the public is everywhere. It is also essential to understand the public's awareness and behavioral response to air pollution. Air pollution complaint data can more directly reflect the public's real air quality perception than social media data. Therefore, based on air pollution complaint data and sentiment analysis, we proposed a new air pollution perception index (APPI) in this paper. Firstly, we constructed the emotional dictionary for air pollution and used sentiment analysis to calculate public complaints' emotional intensity. Secondly, we used the piecewise function to obtain the APPI based on the complaint Kernel density and complaint emotion Kriging interpolation, and we further analyzed the change of center of gravity of the APPI. Finally, we used the proposed APPI to examine the 2012 to 2017 air pollution complaint data in Shandong Province, China. The results were verified by the POI (points of interest) data and word cloud analysis. The results show that: (1) the statistical analysis and spatial distribution of air pollution complaint density and public complaint emotion intensity are not entirely consistent. The proposed APPI can more reasonably evaluate the public perception of air pollution. (2) The public perception of air pollution tends to the southwest of Shandong Province, while coastal cities are relatively weak. (3) The content of public complaints about air pollution mainly focuses on the exhaust emissions of enterprises.

At the same time, the Chinese have enjoyed the rapid economic growth that has contributed to this pollution. While questionnaire-based studies have been conducted within certain regions of China to learn the public's opinions of haze pollution, little work has been done to understand how Chinese citizens value haze treatment in relation to their nation's economic growth at a nationwide scale. To fill this knowledge gap, this project conducted a nationwide investigation of Chinese opinions on the benefits of economic growth versus the disadvantages of haze pollution, as well as their responses to efforts by the Chinese government to combat haze and to the influence of haze on Chinese daily life and on personal health. The study also sought suggestions for combatting haze. In particular, an anonymous questionnaire consisting of 29 questions was given in the summer and fall of 2017 to 1233 people of different genders, ages, child statuses, educational backgrounds, occupations, living areas (rural, suburban, and urban), and living regions. The statistical Chi squared test was then used to identify the demographic group of respondents supporting the economic slowdown policy or requesting more efforts from the Chinese government to combat haze pollution. A multivariate statistical approachprincipal component analysiswas further applied to visualize respondents' feedback on the impact of haze on their daily life and personal health, as well as the change of environment and economic conditions in the last 10 years. The results show that more than 50% of respondents, especially those with children, those between the ages of 31 to 50, and those living in high-pollution regions, supported the economic slowdown policy. Totally 40.63% of the entire group of respondents believed the government's efforts to control haze were small or very small. Only 27.84% of respondents held the opposite opinions. In total, 72.91% of respondents believed the environment in China became worse or much worse in the past 10 years; however, most responded positively to the idea of resolving the haze issue within 15 or more years.

The literature has yet to address whether access to air quality information is sociodemographically stratified, and whether such access correlates with increased uptake of exposure reducing behaviors at the population level. This study represents a first step in answering these questions by analysing responses from the Clean Air Public Insight Tracker nationally representative survey (n = 1,993) of the UK population, administered by UK charity Global Action Plan. Results from logistic regression and zero-inflated negative binomial models estimate 28% of the population have accessed air pollution information, while the odds of younger individuals (ages 18-36), men, and non-white individuals of accessing digitally available air quality information are greater that those outside these categories.

The purpose of this paper is to report on the preliminary IAQ assessment of selected air-conditioned laboratories and naturally ventilated workshops in a tropical education institution. Design/methodology/approach The concentration levels of five major indoor air pollutants (IAPs) - carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, respirable particulates, formaldehyde (HCHO) and total volatile organic compounds (TVOC) in each sampling area were measured using calibrated air sampling sensors and the tracer-gas analysis was used to determine the ventilation effectiveness. A questionnaire survey was carried out concurrently to study the prevalence of sick building syndrome (SBS) among users of laboratories and workshops and the data collected were statistically analysed using chi(2) test. Findings The air pollutant levels were found to be below the threshold limit values set in the local code of practice on IAQ, except for two of the air-conditioned laboratories. This is possibly due to insufficient ventilation, smaller floor area per occupant ratio, long-term exposure to chemical substances, and improper disposal of the used chemical substances. The total particulate levels were higher in naturally ventilated workshops because such spaces were assigned for mechanical works which involved grinding, welding and fabrication. Besides, it was identified that most of the air contaminant levels were not normally distributed (p<0.05) within the sampling areas and SBS like dry eyes, watery eyes, tiredness and dry throat were reported in both laboratories and workshops. The outcomes of this work suggest that an increase of ventilation rate was necessary to reduce the concentration of the IAPs in air-conditioned laboratories and improved housekeeping would help mitigate the prevalence of SBS symptoms.

While mitigation of high radon levels in homes has been shown to be effective, home mitigation rates remain low. This study examines the barriers and facilitators to radon mitigation in homes from the perspectives of authorities responsible for radon risk management, the mitigation industry (contractors), and residents in four European countries (Belgium, Ireland, Slovenia, and the UK) with high radon risks and low mitigation rates. Methods: A multi-method approach was used to gather data from various stakeholders, including online surveys, content analysis of legal documents, group interviews, workshops, and focus groups. Results: Authorities, contractors, and residents identified various facilitators to radon mitigation, including legal requirements for mitigation, awareness campaigns, low mitigation costs, availability of financial support, accreditation of mitigation contractors, and a perception of radon as a health threat. However, barriers to mitigation were also identified, such as a lack of awareness, fragmented mitigation processes, and inadequate communication between stakeholders. Discussion: The study highlights the complexity of the radon mitigation process and suggests that interventions aimed at increasing mitigation rates should target stakeholders beyond just residents, such as constructors, health professionals, and policy makers.

22,10.1525/elementa.126,A survey on the perceived need and value of decision-support tools for joint mitigation of air pollution and climate change in cities,"von Schneidemesser, E; Kutzner, RD; Schmale, J",2017,ELEMENTA-SCIENCE OF THE ANTHROPOCENE,5,,"Decision-support tools are increasingly popular for informing policy decisions linked to environmental issues. For example, a number of decision-support tools on transport planning provide information on expected effects of different measures (actions, policies, or interventions) on air quality, often combined with information on noise pollution or mitigation costs. These tools range in complexity and scale of applicability, from city to international, and include one or several polluting sectors. However, evaluation of the need and utility of tools to support decisions on such linked issues is often lacking, especially for tools intended to support local authorities at the city scale. Here we assessed the need for and value of combining air pollution and climate change mitigation measures into one decision-support tool and the existing policy context in which such a tool might be used. We developed a prototype decision-support tool for evaluating measures for coordinated management of air quality and climate change; and administered a survey in which respondents used the prototype to answer questions about demand for such tools and requirements to make them useful. Additionally, the survey asked questions about participants' awareness of linkages between air pollution and climate change that are crucial for considering synergies and trade-offs among mitigation measures. Participants showed a high understanding of the linkages between air pollution and climate change, especially recognizing that emissions of greenhouse gases and air pollutants come from the same source. Survey participants were: European, predominantly German; employed across a range of governmental, non-governmental and research organizations; and responsible for a diversity of issues, primarily involving climate change, air pollution or environment. Survey results showed a lack of awareness of decision-support tools and little implementation or regular use. However, respondents expressed a general need for such tools while also recognizing barriers to their implementation, such as limited legal support or lack of time, finances, or manpower. The main barrier identified through this study is the mismatch between detailed information needed from such tools to make them useful at the local implementation scale and the coarser scale information readily available for developing such tools. Significant research efforts at the local scale would be needed to populate decision-support tools with salient mitigation alternatives at the location of implementation.

Methods:From June 2015 to January 2016, researchers randomly selected 2 districts from the 20 districts of Baoding, China. Then, researchers randomly selected two middle schools from two districts. By conducting a stratified cluster sampling and considering one class as a unit, researchers randomly selected, from the other middle school, five first-grade classes, five second-grade classes, five third-grade classes from the one middle school, and three first-grade classes, two second-grade classes, and two third-grade classes. Finally, 1,100 adolescents were investigated by using the demographic questionnaire and the Adolescent Haze-Related Knowledge Awareness Assessment Scale (AHRKAAS). Multiple linear regressions were conducted to explore factors affecting the adolescent haze-related knowledge. Sensitivity analysis was used to confirm associations between influencing factors and AHRKAAS scores. Results:The AHRKAAS score rate was 69.9%. The dimension of human factors of haze formation was the highest (score rate = 85.6%). The dimension of haze harms on the human body was the lowest (score rate = 57.1%). Compared with the group (monthly expenses <300 yuan), the group (monthly expenses >= 600 yuan) had a higher AHRKAAS score (beta = 4.882, 95% CI: 0.979, 8.784).

In this paper, a high-resolution emission inventory (with a horizontal resolution of 3 x 3 km) of air pollutants and CO2 for Nanjing, a typical large city in the Yangtze River Delta, is developed, incorporating the best available information on local sources. Emission factors and activity data at the unit or facility level are collected and compiled using a thorough on-site survey of major sources. Over 900 individual plants, which account for 97% of the city's total coal consumption, are identified as point sources, and all of the emission-related parameters including combustion technology, fuel quality, and removal efficiency of air pollution control devices (APCD) are analyzed. New data-collection approaches including continuous emission monitoring systems and real-time monitoring of traffic flows are employed to improve spatiotemporal distribution of emissions. Despite fast growth of energy consumption between 2010 and 2012, relatively small interannual changes in emissions are found for most air pollutants during this period, attributed mainly to benefits of growing APCD deployment and the comparatively strong and improving regulatory oversight of the large point sources that dominate the levels and spatial distributions of Nanjing emissions overall. The improvement of this city-level emission inventory is indicated by comparisons with observations and other inventories at larger spatial scale. Relatively good spatial correlations are found for SO2, NOx, and CO between the city-scale emission estimates and concentrations at nine state-operated monitoring sites (R = 0.58, 0.46, and 0.61, respectively). The emission ratios of specific pollutants including BC to CO, OC to EC, and CO2 to CO compare well to top-down constraints from ground observations. The interannual variability and spatial distribution of NOx emissions are consistent with NO2 vertical column density measured by the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI). In particular, the Nanjing city-scale emission inventory correlates better with satellite observations than the downscaled Multi-resolution Emission Inventory for China (MEIC) does when emissions from power plants are excluded. This indicates improvement in emission estimation for sectors other than power generation, notably industry and transportation. A high-resolution emission inventory may also provide a basis to consider the quality of instrumental observations.

Growing digitization efforts combined with low data prices facilitated an increase in digital media usage in India. The main objective of this study is to examine the relationship between air pollution levels and digital media activity and determine popular perception regarding digital media's influence in combating air pollution. The aforementioned relationship was established by evaluating the average number of searches on Google from August 2019 to January 2020 in conjunction with the spikes in pollutant concentration. Further, a qualitative analysis was conducted using an assiduously drafted questionnaire which was analyzed by the CART decision tree to explore the attitude and behaviour of people and their opinion on the influence of digital media to combat air pollution in Delhi. The findings underscored that digital media activity related to air pollution was quite high for October and November, a period which saw an acute increase in air pollution levels. The survey highlighted Google as the most preferred and influential source of information related to air pollution. The socio-demographic characteristics played an essential role in the respondent's preferences.

To investigate the similarities and disparities in risk perception concerning air pollution and climate change among residents living in Central Mexico, a cross-sectional survey study was carried out within three metropolitan areas encompassed by the Megalopolis. A total of 1750 questionnaire surveys were conducted across 21 municipalities within the Mexico City Metropolitan Area (MCMA), 16 municipalities within the Toluca Valley Metropolitan Area (TVMA), and 8 municipalities within the Cuernavaca Metropolitan Area.

To investigate the similarities and disparities in risk perception concerning air pollution and climate change among residents living in Central Mexico, a cross-sectional survey study was carried out within three metropolitan areas encompassed by the Megalopolis. A total of 1750 questionnaire surveys were conducted across 21 municipalities within the Mexico City Metropolitan Area (MCMA), 16 municipalities within the Toluca Valley Metropolitan Area (TVMA), and 8 municipalities within the Cuernavaca Metropolitan Area.

However, the mechanism underlying this negative relationship has not been fully explored. This study postulated that this impact may occur through individual resilience, a major psychological capital for adolescents. In addition, we studied interpersonal relations, namely, adolescents' perceived family and teacher support, which may moderate the proposed relationship. Methods: This study combined the three-year tracking survey data of 11-to-15 old adolescents (N=1301; approximately 48% female) in China with objective data from the air quality index (AQI) to measure the level of air pollution.Results: Findings from ordinary least squares analysis indicated that air pollution negatively influences adolescents' prosocial behavior, and their resilience mediates this negative relationship. In addition, the results showed that the negative effect of air pollution on adolescent resilience is attenuated by higher family income, whereas it is accentuated by the absence of teacher support. Conclusion: Our study provides insight into how the negative effect of air pollution on adolescents' prosocial behavior is mediated by their psychological resilience, and highlights the moderating role of adolescents' interpersonal relations in the association between air pollution and their psychological resilience.

Strategies to reduce air pollution exposure can therefore help prevent cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. This study was conducted to assess the awareness among U.S. adults of the effect of air pollution on cardiovascular health and actions individuals can take to reduce their air pollution exposure. Methods: In May–July 2022, 4,156 adults responded to the summer wave of the 2022 ConsumerStyles survey and self-reported their heart disease status and perceptions, awareness, and behaviors about ambient air pollution and health. In 2023, the data were analyzed to generate weighted population estimates representative of noninstitutionalized U.S. adults. Associations between heart disease and responses about perceptions, awareness, and behaviors were estimated using binomial and multinomial regression methods for weighted data. Results: Overall, 90% of the weighted population estimate of U.S. adults reported that air pollution can impact a person's health, and 44% reported that air pollution can cause or worsen heart disease.

The required information was collected from 120 sampled respondents through a structured questionnaire. The ordinary least squares method was used for assessing the impact of various factors on the treatment cost of the most recent episode of ailment related to air pollution. The ordered logit model was used to assess the impacts of factors affecting the willingness to pay for programs aimed at the provision of better environmental services. The results revealed that high air pollution in the urban area resulted in more lost workdays and higher health costs.

Thus, the goal of this study was to find out the economic impacts (treatment cost) of air pollution on households as well as the principal factors inducing an individual's willingness to pay for better air quality. District Faisalabad was purposively selected for sampling, as it is a major industrial hub in Pakistan. The required information was collected from 120 sampled respondents through a structured questionnaire. The ordinary least squares method was used for assessing the impact of various factors on the treatment cost of the most recent episode of ailment related to air pollution. The ordered logit model was used to assess the impacts of factors affecting the willingness to pay for programs aimed at the provision of better environmental services. The results revealed that high air pollution in the urban area resulted in more lost workdays and higher health costs. The findings also showed that people were willing to pay for better air quality in urban areas than in rural areas.

This research examines guidance school and high school students' ideas about air pollution and the results may be useful for the respective authorities to improve cultural and educational aspects of next generation. In this cross-sectional study, a closed questionnaire was used to examine knowledge and ideas of 2140 randomly selected school students of Tehran-Iran about composition of unpolluted air, air pollution and its causes and consequences. Cognitive scores were also calculated. Outcomes were compared with results of similar researches in Australia, Hong Kong and the United Kingdom. While a student's 'cognitive score' could range from -16 to +16, Iranian students' mean cognitive score was equal to +2.97. There was not significant statistical difference between girls and boys (P=0.32). In response to question ""most common gas in unpolluted air"" nitrogen was mentioned by only 23.7%, While 45.1% of students mentioned oxygen.

This research examines guidance school and high school students' ideas about air pollution and the results may be useful for the respective authorities to improve cultural and educational aspects of next generation. In this cross-sectional study, a closed questionnaire was used to examine knowledge and ideas of 2140 randomly selected school students of Tehran-Iran about composition of unpolluted air, air pollution and its causes and consequences. Cognitive scores were also calculated. Outcomes were compared with results of similar researches in Australia, Hong Kong and the United Kingdom. While a student's 'cognitive score' could range from -16 to +16, Iranian students' mean cognitive score was equal to +2.97. There was not significant statistical difference between girls and boys (P=0.32). In response to question ""most common gas in unpolluted air"" nitrogen was mentioned by only 23.7%, While 45.1% of students mentioned oxygen.

Methods: From September 2015 to March 2016, in parallel with the number of exceedances of the PM10 in Italy we evaluated the press coverage, the average monthly searches on Google and the interest on Twitter. Moreover, a qualitative content analysis on daily newspapers was conducted and a self-compiled questionnaire on the attitudes and behaviors about environmental issues and their determinants was administered to 598 parents involved in the project MAPEC_LIFE (LIFE12 ENV/IT/00614). Results: The media coverage of the theme of air pollution was very high from the end of 2015 to the beginning of 2016, as well as internet searches and twitter messages. Our qualitative analysis highlighted that only a small portion of articles included information about positive behaviors and environmental awareness.

Numerous studies have linked long-term exposure to nitrous oxide and halogenated agents to, among other things, reproductive problems in PACU nurses and anesthesiologists. Microorganism contamination can result in a post-surgical complication, to which patients with diabetes and other respiratory diseases are especially vulnerable. Various researchers and governmental agencies have recommended hospitals take steps to reduce levels of airborne contaminants in PACUs. In particular, hazard communication programs are recommended to inform and train staff on relevant occupational health and safety procedures. Additionally, and perhaps more importantly, experts recommend hospitals install specialized ventilation systems to maintain low levels of airborne pollutants. Objective: This study has two main parts: (1) measurement of airborne contaminants in the PACU at Rajavithi Hospital in Bangkok, Thailand; and (2) assessment of PACU workers’ perceived level of importance regarding occupational health and safety protocols, via self-reporting survey. The study also has two main objectives: (1) to determine whether, and to what extent, a new ventilation system helps reduce airborne contaminants in the PACU; and (2) to discover whether an informational campaign increases perceived importance of health and safety procedures among PACU workers (i.e. handwashing, changing shoes, wearing proper facemasks). Methods: Surveys and air quality measurements were collected two times - in July 2016 and April 2017 - before and after Rajavithi Hospital implemented a hazard communication program consisting of training, posters, brochures, and informational media. Survey participants included all 64 PACU workers - 61 nurses and 3 anesthetists. Air sampling measured levels of bacteria, fungi, nitrous oxide, and desflurane. Results: Initial levels of airborne microorganisms were very high (1307CFU/m3 for bacteria and 70.4 CFU/m3 for fungi) and on the high end of normal for nitrous oxide (21.86ppm). Following the informational campaign and installation of the ventilation system, levels of bacterial contamination fell to 182 CFU/m3, and fungi fell to 35.8 CFU/m3. Simultaneously, workers’ levels of perceived importance for health and safety procedures increased. Conclusion: Both aspects of the study were successful, however, concentration of airborne microorganisms still exceeded recommended limits at the end of the study.

In the view of public awareness, the aim of this study was to explore factors that affect air quality perception and to reveal its potential patterns. Air quality perception of individuals, in terms of dust and overall air quality, was examined in relation to air pollutants concentrations, meteorological variables, personal characteristics as well as their thermal sensation and health condition. The data used were obtained from environmental measurements, in situ and from stations, and questionnaire surveys conducted in an outdoor urban Mediterranean area, Athens, Greece. The participants were asked to report their air quality perception and thermal sensation based on predefined scales. A thermal index, Physiological Equivalent Temperature (PET), was estimated to obtain an objective measure of thermal sensation. Particulate matter (PM10) and nitrogen oxide (NO) were associated with dust perception. Nitrogen oxides (NOx) and carbon monoxide (CO) were associated to air quality perception. Age, area of residence, health symptoms and thermal sensation also affected the perception of air quality. Dusty or poor air quality conditions were more likely to be reported when pollutants' concentrations were increased. Younger people, participants residing in the city center, experiencing health symptoms or warm thermal sensation showed a trend towards reporting more unfavorable air quality conditions.

Many of these services can only be realized when people visit parks. Particulate matter exposure poses negative health impacts and may turn the health benefits brought by park visits into health risks. This tradeoff relationship is heavily moderated by how individuals behave under varying ambient air quality conditions. While there is a growing evidence base regarding the benefits brought by urban parks, little is known about how people adjust their park visitation to air pollution. Here we use two approaches to understand if air quality affects urban park visits in Beijing: a stated preference survey on social media and a year-long faceto-face survey in a neighborhood park. Quantile regression and ANOVA analysis were used. We found particulate pollution has a negative impact on the maximum number of visits a park may receive. A significant drop occurred when the pollution level changed from moderate to heavy pollution. Therefore, the ecosystem services provided by parks are not fully realized due to the reduced number of visits caused by air pollution. Second, regardless of how poor air quality is, a proportion of people (41-64%) put themselves at exposure risk to enjoy the benefits brought by parks. Third, the inconsistency between behavior and intention signals people are less protected from the potential adverse health impacts of poor air quality than they think. Future study should look into what factors may cause the divergence between people's intentions and behaviors.

Results showed that when occupants did not check the numerical data of IAQ factors, they tended to perceive IAQ based on the perceived thermal comfort. In addition, occupants made a biased judgment of the current IAQ condition based on the past perceived IAQ checked 30 min ago. When occupants checked the numerical data of IAQ factors, they responded more sensitively to IAQ factors than to thermal environment factors when perceiving IAQ conditions. The results of this study confirmed that real-time numerical data of IAQ factors measured using monitoring devices are essential for occupants to perceive and judge the current IAQ clearly.

The Contingent Valuation Method (CVM) was used to qualitatively and quantitatively measure the willingness to pay (WTP) for reducing children's RDs through air quality improvement. Methods: Between April and May, 2014, 975 face-to-face interviews were collected from parents in a community-based and a hospital-setting in Shanghai. Multiple imputation and the Probit model were used to determine the relationship between the WTP and the related environmental factors, child health factors and the socio-economic status. Results: Most respondents reported being willing to make a financial contribution to improve air quality in both the community (52.6%) and hospital (70.2%) samples. Those in the hospital setting were willing to pay significantly more ¥504 (USD$80.7) compared to the community sample ¥428 ($68.5) as expected. Reasons for those not being willing to pay included lack of disposable income and believing that responsibility of the air quality was a community issue. These did not differ by sample. Annual household income and education were related to WTP. Conclusion: This study indicated that parents in Shanghai would be willing to pay for improved air quality. Children's health can be the incentive for the citizens' participation and support in the air quality improvement, therefore, hospital settings may present unique places to improve education about air quality and enhance advocacy efforts.

Moreover, 90% of the 150,000 patients at Al Ain Hospital suffered from upper respiratory tract respiratory diseases, bronchitis, or asthma. Sick Building Syndrome (SBS) has emerged as a social problem in the United Arab Emirates (UAE). The Dubai Municipality regulates Indoor Air Quality (IAQ) with strict stipulations before moving in, but they are relatively passive about regulations related to healthy living. This paper aims to explore the actual state of perception of the IAQ from townhouse residents in Dubai, UAE. The characteristics of the resident's perceptions of the IAQ are identified, and the influential factors affecting residents' perceptions of IAQ are extracted. As a methodology, the survey was conducted on four townhouse projects in Dubai from December 2021 to January 2022. A total of 114 copies were distributed, and 98 documents were used. Analysis of the survey data was processed using IBM SPSS Statistics 26.0. The results showed a statistically significant correlation between the cognitive and anxiety levels of SBS with the presence or absence of experience. It was statistically confirmed that the most influential factors were the age of the children and the occupancy time of housewives and children. This is because of the perception that wives who spend a relatively long time in the house and their young children are exposed to indoor air pollution for a long period of time and are easily affected by this influence on the concerns about young children about SBS. Ninety-five percent of the respondents answered that they knew more than average about SBS, indicating a very high level of awareness.

Poor air quality has been associated with adverse pulmonary and cardiac health effects, particularly among susceptible populations with underlying disease. In addition to reducing pollution concentrations, risk communication efforts that inform behavior modification have the potential to reduce public health burdens associated with air pollution. Methods: This study investigates the utilization of Mexico's IMECA risk communication index to inform air pollution avoidance behavior among the general population living in the Mexico City Metropolitan Area. Individuals were selected via probability sampling and surveyed by phone about their air quality index knowledge, pollution concerns, and individual behaviors. Results: The results indicated reasonably high awareness of the air quality index (53% of respondents), with greater awareness in urban areas, among older and more educated individuals, and for those who received air quality information from a healthcare provider. Additionally, behavior modification was less influenced by index reports as it was by personal perceptions of air quality, and there was no difference in behavior modification among susceptible and non-susceptible groups.

Thus, this paper pays attention to residents' willingness to buy anti-haze cosmetics through customer perceived value theory. In this study, it is assumed that all consumers are rational economic people and that anti-haze cosmetics on the market can effectively cleanse, isolate and repair haze damage. Based on customer perceived value theory and the characteristic of anti-haze cosmetics, four main drivers and had been selected out, that is, monetary value, social value, brand value and perceived haze awareness. Then, based on 314 valid questionnaires, the structural equation analysis method had been used to analyze the impact of the four dimensions of customer perceived value theory on perceived value and consumers' purchase intention of anti-haze cosmetics. The empirical results showed that monetary value, social value, and perceived haze awareness had positive impact on perceived value and purchase intention of anti-haze cosmetics, while brand value only affects perceived value. Perceived value was a partial mediator between the relations of monetary value, social value, perceived haze awareness and purchase intention, while played a completely mediating role between brand value and purchase intention. Then, we also found that price sensitivity played a significant down-modulatory role in perceived value and purchase intention. Furthermore, the perceived haze awareness is the term that we first proposed in this realm, which extends and optimizes Customer Perceived Value.

Especially during heatwaves, street canyons are both producers and sufferers of air pollution and urban heat island (UHI) effects, with severe risks on public health. To better design mitigation measures, it is important to consider both the mi-croclimate behaviors as well as the perceptions of the local population. Therefore, this study examined pedestrian perceptions and microclimate modelings to understand outdoor thermal comfort conditions and air pollution dispersion in the case study neighborhood of Dortmund Marten, Germany. A field survey with measurement points at two street canyons for climatic variables and questionnaires on subjective thermal comfort and air pol-lution was conducted on a hot day during the heatwave period in August 2020. As a cost-effective method for modeling input generation, we extracted spatial and spectral data like albedo, roof materials and tree locations out of remote sensing imageries. Finally, we compared the modeling results of the physiological equivalent tem-perature (PET) index, particulate matter concentrations and air temperatures with empirical field measurement data and the questionnaire responses. Results indicate that during hot summer days with light winds from the east, the north-south orientated street canyon with tree arrangements tends to act as a tunnel for particulate matter accumulation. Coincidently, pedestrians show less thermal discomfort than calculated PET values in that particular area during morning and daytime, which underlines the dichotomy of such places. On the other hand, the low rise east-west orientated street canyon shows higher PET votes than predicted by the model. How-ever, particulate matter concentrations were considerably underestimated by the model, while air temperature predictions provided meaningful results. The proposed workflow shows the potential to accelerate future prep-arations of input data for microclimate modelings, while the results can enhance wind-sensitive planning proce-dures and heat stress resilience in mid-latitude urban neighborhoods.

In addition, an online (Qualtrics) structured questionnaire was used to assess occupants' perceptions of the indoor environment. Results of the airborne flora showed 833 cfu/m(3) recovered on a Malt Extract Agar (MEA) plate in the morning and 1213 cfu/m(3) in the afternoon. A similar result was noticed on a Plate Count Agar (PCA) plate during the morning period (731 cfu/m(3)) and afternoon (1358 cfu/m(3)).

Public perceptions of air pollution are important for individual self-protection and policy-making. Given the uncertainty faced by residence-based exposure (RB) measurements, this study measures individuals’ real-time mobility-based (MB) exposures and perceptions of air pollution by considering people’s daily movement. It explores how contextual uncertainties may influence the disparities in perceived air quality by taking into account RB and MB environmental factors. In addition, we explore factors that are related to the mismatch between people’s perceived air quality and actual air pollution exposure. Using K-means clustering to divide the PM2.5 values into two groups, a mismatch happens when the perceived air quality is poor but the air pollution level is lower than 15.536μg/m3 and when the perceived air quality is good but the air pollution level is higher than 15.608μg/m3. The results show that there is a mismatch between air pollution exposure and perception of air pollution. People with low income are exposed to higher air pollution. Unemployed people and people with more serious mental health symptoms (e.g., depression) have a higher chance of accurately assessing air pollution (e.g., perceiving air quality as poor when air pollution levels are high). Older people and those with a higher MB open space density tend to underestimate air pollution. Students tend to perceive air quality as good. People who are surrounded by higher MB transportation land-use density and green space density tend to perceive air quality as poor.

Prolonged exposure to vehicle emissions has led to various health issues for everyone, but traffic policies might be particularly affected. This study aims to evaluate their knowledge, attitudes, and practices regarding air pollution, with the goal of raising awareness and promoting healthier practices to mitigate the adverse effects of pollution. Methodology: A cross-sectional survey was carried out from January to March 2023 across five zones in Dhaka City, Bangladesh. Using a convenience sampling method, 401 male participants with a mean age = 39.24 ± 6.25 years were recruited. The survey employed a semi-structured questionnaire that covered informed consent, socio-demographic data, and included sections on knowledge (9 items), attitudes (6 items), and practices (7 items) related to air pollution and its health effects. Data analysis was conducted with Microsoft Excel (version 2019), SPSS (version 25.0), and STATA (version 15.0). Result: The average scores for knowledge, attitudes, and practices were 7.62 out of 9, 11.06 out of 18, and 14.53 out of 21, respectively. Higher knowledge scores were associated with education (p < 0.001), higher monthly family income (p < 0.001), and having 15 or fewer years of work experience (p = 0.040). Attitudes were positively linked to education (p < 0.001), higher income (p < 0.001), working in the same area for over a year (p < 0.001), asthma (p = 0.042), cardiovascular diseases (p = 0.027), and coughing symptoms (p < 0.001). Practices were positively influenced by lower income (p = 0.031), absence of breathing problems/asthma (p = 0.023), and absence of coughing symptoms (p < 0.001). Conclusion: This study suggests that education, income, and work experience are likely influential factors shaping knowledge, attitudes, and practices regarding air pollution.

The aims of this study are to monitor and measure particulate matter (PM2.5), as well as to study the people's perception of air quality and their willingness to contribute to controlling air pollution in Phnom Penh. Realtime data of PM2.5 concentration was monitored from October 2018 through January 2019 by using a light-scattering sensor in downtown Chamkar Mon, Tuoll kork, and Chraoy Changva districts which were the places remarked as highly trafficked. The design questionnaire on the perception of people on air pollution and air quality was assessed through an online form called the KoboToolbox application, using simple random sampling. PM2.5 concentrations ranges from 14.879 to 33.481 μg/m3. The concentration found, is obviously above the standard level of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has set. The air quality becomes deteriorated, while participants' subjective assessment of air quality mostly has a neutral opinion. They don't seem to take careful attention to how air quality becomes which reveals a significant difference between people's perceptions and reality. Most participants have a negative impression greatly on vehicles. Seventy-seven and a haft percent of participants recognize vehicles as the main pollution sources followed by industrial facilities, open burning, construction sites, and BBQ restaurants by 52.50 %, 25.83 %, 24.16 %, and 5 %, respectively. Haft of the participants (50.83 %) are unaware of what is sub-degree 2000 related to air quality and noise management still, 65 % of participants give a positive attitude concerning the willingness to report air pollution cases regardless of incentive. Nearly 80 % of participants utilize social media, Facebook to perceive knowledge and related information about air. The result of the survey questionnaire in this study will be an initiative for policymakers to enhance legislative on-air quality management. However, the collective responsibility of society and individual contributors play important role in air quality control measures.

Promoting physical activity (PA) and avoiding sedentary behavior (SB) serve as key strategies to maintain and improve human health. However, ambient air pollution can adversely affect PA and SB, increasing the risks of health problems. This study aimed to visualize national spatial patterns of average AQI concentration, PA, and SB distributions and to examine the associations between air pollution and PA and SB in a national sample of Chinese older adults aged 60 years or older. Methods: We analyzed the data of the China Longitudinal Aging Social Survey 2020 (CLASS 2020), which sampled 11,399 older men and women from 30 cities in China. Moderate, vigorous, and light PA and SB were measured using the Chinese version of the International Physical Activity Questionnaire-Short Form (IPAQ-C). The environmental measures included the average hourly air quality index (AQI), PM2.5, PM10, and NO2 (µg/m3). The data were analyzed using multivariable linear regression. Results: Increases in the standard deviations (±SD) of AQI, PM2.5, PM10, and NO2 concentrations were associated with decreases in MVPA per week of −2.34 (95%CI = −3.36, −1.32), −2.58 (95%CI = −3.61, −1.55), −1.96 (95%CI = −3.05, −0.08), and −1.19 (95%CI = −2.06, −0.31) and decreases in LPA per week of −6.06 (95%CI = −7.15, −4.97), −4.86 (95%CI = −5.88, −3.85), −4.78 (95%CI = −5.89, −3.68), and −4.59 (95%CI = −5.57, −3.61) h/week, respectively.

114,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2024.174759,Association between outdoor jogging behavior and PM2.5 exposure: Evidence from massive GPS trajectory data in Beijing,Guo W.; He J.; Yang W.,2024,,947.0,,"Outdoor jogging is one of the most popular practised exercises worldwide, providing various benefits for health and wellbeing. However, PM2.5 exposure risks of jogging behaviors were rarely explored. This study aims to investigate the association between jogging behavior and PM2.5 exposure with big data. PM2.5 exposure concentration and dose inhalation of individuals were calculated by integrating hourly PM2.5 concentration data and jogging GPS trajectory recorded by a sports app during 2015 in Beijing, after which relationships between jogging behaviors and PM2.5 exposure were unpacked using statistics analysis and structural equation modelling. Experimental results on massive jogging trajectories show that: (1) the average jogging PM2.5 exposure concentration is 60.43 μg/m3, and female joggers inhaled significantly less air pollution dose (19.70 μg) than men (24.91 μg). (2) There exist significant spatiotemporal disparities in jogging exposure to PM2.5. Joggings in the city center, in the morning, on weekdays and in autumn and winter seasons were exposed to higher pollution concentrations. (3) Jogging behavior characteristics, especially distance, activity space size, duration and rotation, were systematically associated with PM2.5 exposure across space and time.

However, PM2.5 exposure risks of jogging behaviors were rarely explored. This study aims to investigate the association between jogging behavior and PM2.5 exposure with big data. PM2.5 exposure concentration and dose inhalation of individuals were calculated by integrating hourly PM2.5 concentration data and jogging GPS trajectory recorded by a sports app during 2015 in Beijing, after which relationships between jogging behaviors and PM2.5 exposure were unpacked using statistics analysis and structural equation modelling. Experimental results on massive jogging trajectories show that: (1) the average jogging PM2.5 exposure concentration is 60.43 μg/m3, and female joggers inhaled significantly less air pollution dose (19.70 μg) than men (24.91 μg). (2) There exist significant spatiotemporal disparities in jogging exposure to PM2.5. Joggings in the city center, in the morning, on weekdays and in autumn and winter seasons were exposed to higher pollution concentrations. (3) Jogging behavior characteristics, especially distance, activity space size, duration and rotation, were systematically associated with PM2.5 exposure across space and time.

Methods: A total of 2105 children (52.02% male; aged 7.33 ± 0.60 years at baseline) were enrolled from the Chongqing Children's Health Cohort. A mixed linear regression model was used to analyse the relationships of PM2.5 levels with obesity indicators after adjusting for covariates. Additionally, a Poisson regression model was used to determine the relationship between PM2.5 exposure and the incidence of overweight/obesity. Results: The average PM2.5 exposure levels from participant conception to 2014, from 2015 to 2017, and from 2018 to 2019 were 66.64 ± 5.33 μg/m3, 55.49 ± 3.78 μg/m3, and 42.50 ± 1.87 μg/m3, respectively; these levels significantly decreased over time (P < 0.001). Throughout the entire follow-up period, the incidence of overweight/obesity after a ≥ 25 μg/m3 decrease in the PM2.5 level was 4.57% among females; this incidence was the lowest among females who experienced remarkable decreases in PM2.5 exposure. A 1-µg/m3 decrease in the PM2.5 level significantly decreased the body mass index (BMI), BMI z score (BMIz), and weight of adolescents (all P < 0.001). Compared with a < 20-μg/m3 decrease in the PM2.5 level, a ≥ 25-μg/m3 decrease protected against increased BMI (net difference= −0.93; 95% confidence interval [CI]: (−1.23,−0.63) kg/m2), BMIz (−0.28 (−0.39, −0.17)), weight (−1.59 (−2.44, −0.74) kg), and incidence of overweight/obesity (0.48 (0.37, 0.62), P < 0.001). Moreover, compared with a < 20-μg/m3 decrease in the PM2.5 level, a ≥ 25-μg/m3 decrease resulted in significant absolute differences in BMI (−1.26 (−1.56, −0.96) kg/m2), BMIz (−0.53 (−0.65, −0.40)) and weight (−3.01 (−3.8, −2.19) kg) (all P < 0.001). Conclusions: This study showed the etiological relevance of declining PM2.5 concentrations for the incidence of obesity in children and adolescents, suggesting that controlling ambient air pollutants may prevent the development of obesity in this age group.

120,10.3961/jpmph.19.180,Associations of ambient air pollutant concentrations with respiratory symptoms and perceived health status in Japanese adults with and without chronic respiratory diseases: A panel study,Nakao M.; Yamauchi K.; Mitsuma S.; Odaira T.; Obata H.; Chijimatsu Y.; Ishihara Y.,2019,,52.0,6,"Objectives: In recent years, transboundary air pollution from mainland East Asia has led to growing concerns about air pollution in Japan. Air pollution is reportedly associated with the exacerbation of respiratory diseases. In this study, we assessed the effects of air pollution on respiratory symptoms and the health status of participants with and without chronic respiratory diseases. Methods: Participants (n=2753) with and without chronic respiratory diseases who visited healthcare facilities in Japan during February from 2010 to 2015 filled out a self-report questionnaire regarding their symptoms and perceived health status. Participants were followed up during April-May and June-July. Results: Oxidant concentrations were associated with respiratory symptoms, overall health, and quality of life (QoL). Suspended particulate matter (SPM) and particulate matter <2.5 μm levels were associated with physical fitness; SPM was also associated with QoL. Recent experience of an Asian sand dust event had a significant effect on allergic symptoms, change in health, and QoL. Conclusions: Respiratory symptoms were more strongly affected by oxidants than by other pollutants. Significant associations of air pollutants were found with a comprehensive range of items related to perceived health status, including overall health and QoL. Although the effects of air pollutants on respiratory symptoms and health status were more apparent among patients with respiratory diseases, the adverse effects of air pollutants were significant even among participants without such conditions.

This article provides the findings of a study carried out among the residents of Warsaw, the capital of Poland, in order to assess social awareness of air pollution and the importance of trees. The study of the residents’ awareness was supplemented with the assessment of the parameters of the trees’ capacity for pollution absorption in selected locations performed with the help of the i‐Tree Eco tool, which allowed the authors to compare the residents’ impressions on the role of trees in the process of absorption of pollution with their actual potential. The analyses showed that the majority of city residents are concerned with the problem of air in the city, but at the same time failing to notice its negative impact on their health.

Hg, Fe, Mn, Zn, Cu, Ni and Cr showed a maximum concentration concurrent with the dry weight of the SPM. whereas the maximum concentrations of As, Pb, and Cd coincided with the particle number concentration peak. The concentration of particulate matter decreased rapidly. unlike the concentrations of dissolved substances such as DOC and trace metals, as well as the values of UV extinction, all of which remained high for a longer period. Comparing the results of the 2002 flood with the winter floods in 1995, 1999 and 2000, revealed increased values of As and Pb as well as higher concentrations of dissolved compounds. river; flood; transport; suspended particulate matter; trace metals; dissolved compounds; Elbe Central Europe; Elbe River; Eurasia; Europe; dissolved matter; flood; pollutant transport; river flow; sediment transport; suspended particulate matter; trace metal HEAVY-METALS; SEDIMENTS; BALANCES; ELEMENTS; AREA","```json

134,,Cabin environment and perception of cabin air quality among commercial aircrew,Lindgren T.; Norback D.; Andersson K.; Dammstrom B.,2000,,71.0,8,"Objective: Our objective was to study the perception of cabin air quality (CAQ) and cabin environment (CE) among commercial cabin crew, and to measure different aspects of CAQ on intercontinental flights. Methods: A standardized questionnaire was mailed in February-March 1997 to all Stockholm-based aircrew on duty in a Scandinavian flight company (n = 1857), and office workers from the same company (n = 218). The answers were compared with an external reference group for the questionnaire (MM 040 NA). During this time, smoking was allowed on intercontinental flights, but not on other shorter flights. Smoking was prohibited on all flights after 1 September 1997. The participation rate was 81% (n = 1513) in the aircrew, and 77% (n = 168) in the office group. Air humidity, temperature, carbon dioxide (CO2) and respirable dust were measured during intercontinental flights, during both smoking and non-smoking conditions. Statistical analysis was performed by multiple logistic regression analysis, keeping age, gender, smoking, current smoking, occupation, and perceived psychosocial work environment simultanously in the model. Results: Air humidity was very low (mean 5%) during intercontinental flights. In most cases (97%) the CO2 concentration was below 1000 ppm. The average concentration of respirable particles was 67 μ · g m-3 during smoking conditions, and 4 μg · m-3 during non-smoking conditions. Complaints of draftiness, too high temperature, varying temperature, stuffy air, dry air, static electricity, noise, inadequate illumination, and dust were more common among aircrew as compared with office workers from the same company. Female crew had more complaints on too low temperature, dry air, and dust. Current smokers had less complaints on stuffy air and environmental tobacco smoke (ETS). Younger subjects and those with atopy (childhood eczema, allergy to tree or grass pollen, or furry animals) reported more complaints. Reports on work stress and lack of influence on working conditions were strongly related to perception of a poor cabin environment. Flight deck crew had more complaints about inadequate illumination and dust, but less complaints about other aspects of the cabin environment, as compared with flight attendants. Aircrew who had been on a flight the previous week, where smoking was allowed, had more complaints on dry air and ETS. Conclusion: Complaints about work environment seems to be more common among aircrew than office workers, particularly draft, stuffy air, dry air, static electricity, noise, inadequate illumination and dust. We could identify personal factors of importance, and certain conditions that could be improved, to achieve a better perception of the cabin environment.

Comparative results from choice experiment analysis,Zheng D.; Ao C.; Mao B.; Xu L.,2022,,808.0,,"Based on choice experiment (CE), evaluating the public's heterogeneous preferences and willingness to pay (WTP) for air pollution treatment policies can provide useful social views for the reasonable formulation of treatment schemes.

In reality, for a variety of reasons, not all respondents are absolutely certain about their responses, this assumption distinctly is hard to be consistent with reality. To explore the impact of respondent uncertainty on the public's WTP and heterogeneous preferences for air pollution treatment policies, this study introduces the critical point and exponential weighting methods to deal with this uncertainty in the context of CE and conducts comparative analysis based on the random parameters logit (RPL) and latent classes models (LCM). The results show that, ignoring uncertainty leads to distortions in the public's WTP and preference characteristics. In the RPL models, on average, the WTP for attributes is overstated by 32.10%. Our results also reveal that, whether to consider uncertainty does not affect the ranking of the implicit prices of these attributes. After incorporating uncertainty into the analysis, respondents were divided into two potential groups with different preferences, namely the environment-focused group (79.44%) and the price-focused group (20.56%), which is quite distinct from research results of ignoring the uncertainty.

Methods: In the 2012 Korean Community Health Survey, survey data on socioeconomic characteristics, health-related behaviors, and previous cancer history were collected from 100,867 participants. Daily average concentrations of PM10 and O-3 (2003-2012) were obtained from the Korean Air Pollutants Emission Service.

In order to investigate the chemical characteristics of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) after the “coal substitution” policy, the PM2.5 samples were collected in the winter of Handan during four pollution periods from 2018 to 2020 and one pollution period in the counties of Wei and Jize in 2020 to analyze the water-soluble ions and carbonaceous aerosols. In Handan, the PM2.5 concentration in the winter decreased by 40.8% in 2020, compared with the initial stage of the implementation of the “coal substitution” policy in 2015. It indicated that the implementation of the “coal substitution” policy effectively improved the air quality. During the four pollution periods, the PM2.5 was alkaline with the average mass concentrations were (153.9±97.7), (164.5±78.7), (137.3±72.9) and (161.8± 84.3) μg/ m3, respectively. The average mass concentration of PM2.5 in Wei and Jize were (123.5±47.3) and (124.5± 53.4) μg/ m3, respectively. The analysis of water-soluble ions showed that the content of SNA (NH+4, NO-3, and SO24-) was the highest, accounting for 85.3% -90.0% of the total concentration of water-soluble ions. Compared with that in the winter of 2016 in Handan, the concentration of Cl-, as a tracer of coal combustion, decreased by 48.0% after the “coal substitution” policy, explaining the good results of the “coal substitution” policy. The ratio of NO-3 to SO24- mass concentration showed that the contribution of mobile sources (vehicle exhaust) was higher than that of stationary sources (coal combustion). The carbon aerosol analysis showed that the proportion of total carbon (TC) in PM2.5 decreased by 55.2%. In all survey regions, the organic carbon (OC) to elemental carbon (EC) ratio was greater than 2, demonstrating the existence of secondary organic carbon (SOC) pollution. The results of correlation analysis and principal component analysis showed that the main sources of carbon aerosols in Handan gradually changed from coal combustion and vehicle exhaust to biomass combustion during the implementation of the “coal substitution” policy.

Moreover, this study also allowed to understand which information about air quality needs further dissemination to provide the citizens with all the available tools and the correct knowledge. For this, a national online survey about air quality perception was conducted, where 1131 answers were obtained and two different populations were compared: the general population and a sub-population from an urban-industrial area of Lisbon metropolitan area that had experienced frequent air pollution events in the past. Air pollution was considered the environmental topic of higher concern among this sub-population (61.4%), while in the general population it ranked thirdly (27.4%). Generally, the sub-population showed higher knowledge about air quality than the general population, with 61% being able to identify at least one air pollutant. The perception of the local air quality was also very different between populations, with 61% of the sub-population considering it poor or very poor, while only 14% of the general population had the same perception, which highlights the different levels of concern between populations. A weak knowledge about air pollutants (50% of the general population could not identify any air pollutant) and an erroneous perception of the contribution of the different pollution sources to air quality levels were found. More than 50% of the respondents of both populations were considered to not have enough information regarding the air quality in their area of residence, with the national air quality database being unknown to almost everyone.

In order to address this, a range of interventions and policies are being implemented across major European cities and studies in sustainable urban transport have proliferated. One such mitigation strategy involves redesigning urban form through 'hard' traffic policies, with a view of decreasing emission levels and therefore mitigating the effects of air pollution and climate change. However, efforts to assess public response to such interventions and the effectiveness of policy instruments in promoting sustainable travel in cities remain sparse. The city of Potsdam, Germany implemented a trial traffic measure aimed at reducing motorized traffic and promoting the use of bicycles and public transport systems. This study analysed data from 3553 survey participants who responded to a survey conducted prior to the implementation of the traffic measure. We aimed to identify mobility behaviours and underlying attitudes within the context of a 'hard' policy instrument, in order to obtain insight into the opportunities to more effectively define policy priorities that improve air quality and upscale climate mitigation. An exploratory cluster analysis identified four groups, characterised by mobility habits, their attitudes towards the measure, and general level of environmental concern. By identifying and understanding the differing attitudes and perceptions across population groups we are able to highlight group-specific barriers and opportunities, as well as potential transition pathways to encourage more sustainable transportation use.

Informal e-waste recycling methods, such as burning, roasting, acid leaching, and shredding, had resulted in serious air pollution, which is a prominent risk factor for children's health. However, the combined toxicity of air pollutants on children's behavioral health remains unclear. This study collected data on air pollution exposure, calculated the average daily dose (ADD) based on these air pollutants for children in Guiyu (e-waste group, n = 112) and Haojiang (reference group, n = 101), then assessed children's behavioral health using the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ), and further estimated the associations of ADD, inflammatory cytokines, neurotransmitters, and children's behavioral problems. Compared with Haojiang, Guiyu has poorer air quality and higher levels of ADD, inflammatory cytokines (such as IL-1 beta, IL-6, and TNF-alpha), neurotransmitters (such as DA and SP), and SDQ scores, but lower levels of serum neuropeptide Y (NPY) levels. Spearman correlation analyses indicated that there were significant relationships among inflammatory cytokines, neurotransmitters, and behavioral scores. Multiple linear regression analyses showed that each unit increase in ADD was associated with serum levels of DA and SP, the serum NPY subsequently changed by B (95% CI): 0.99 (0.14, 1.84) nmol/L, 0.25 (0.08, 0.42) ng/mL, and - 0.16 (-0.26, -0.05) ng/mL, respectively.

We analyzed the case of Seoul, South Korea, where nationwide environmental concern in regard to PM pollution recently led to intense policy measures and public communication efforts. To test our conceptual model, we conducted an online survey with 513 Seoul citizens on their perception of PM risk and their behaviour during high PM episodes. Our regression results revealed two key findings.

The aim of the study was to investigate the extent of community awareness and knowledge on the health risks associated with exposure to air pollution. The study was conducted at Annadale residential area locally known as Ladanna surrounded by industrial areas and located in Polokwane Local Municipality under Capricorn District Municipality in Limpopo Province, South Africa.Methods: A cross-sectional study design was used for the study, using self-administered questionnaires. The questionnaire was pre-tested on 10 respondents at Emdo Park (Extension 29) in Polokwane from 02 to 06 February 2021 and another fifteen respondents were pre-tested at Lesedi Park. A simple random sampling technique was used to select 376 respondents. Systematic sampling method was applied to select the households. SPSS version 26 was used to analyze data. Data was presented in the form of frequencies and percentages. Spearman rank correlation was used to measure the degree of association between 2 variables. A Chi-square test was used to compare the groups between the categorical variables.

However, it is unclear to what extent different commuting behaviors are a source of air pollution compared to non-commuters, and if air pollution exposure actually differs by the mode of commuting. This study aimed to examine the relationships between commuting behaviors and air pollution exposure levels measured by urinary 1-OHP (1-hydroxypyrene), a biomarker of exposure to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAT-Is). Methods: A cross-sectional study of 174 volunteers living in Montreal, 92 females and 82 males, aged 20 to 53 years was conducted in 2011. Each participant completed a questionnaire regarding demographic factors, commuting behaviors, home and workplace addresses, and potential sources of PAH exposure, and provided a complete first morning void urine sample for 1-OHP analysis. Multivariable general linear regression models were used to examine the relationships between different types of commuting and urinary 1-OHP levels. Results: Compared to non-commuters, commuters traveling by foot or bicycle and by car or truck had a significantly higher urinary 1-OHP concentration in urine (p = 0.01 for foot or bicycle vs. non-commuters; p = 0.02 for car or truck vs. non-commuters); those traveling with public transportation and combinations of two or more types of modes tended to have an increased 1-OHP level in urine (p = 0.06 for public transportation vs. non-commuters; p = 0.05 for commuters with combinations of two or more types of modes vs. non-commuters). No significant difference in urinary 1-OHP variation was found by mode of commuting. Conclusion: This preliminary study suggests that despite the mode of commuting, all types of commuting during rush hours increase exposure to air pollution as measured by a sensitive PAH metabolite biomarker, and mode of commuting did not explain exposure variation.

162,10.1108/MEQ-03-2019-0070,Conceptualization of an urban travel behavior model to mitigate air pollution for sustainable environmental development in Malaysia,Jayaraman K.; Leow N.X.; Asirvatham D.; Chan H.R.,2020,,31.0,3,"Purpose: Global issues on the environment, such as climate change, air pollution and carbon monoxide emission, are the primary concerns in any part of the world. The purpose of this paper is to construct a conceptual framework for the travel behavior performance of a commuter, and it is expected to mitigate air pollution from vehicle emission and to promote smart mobility on the road. Design/methodology/approach: From the extensive literature review, the conceptual framework for the travel behavior performance of a commuter has been developed and is supported by the theory of interpersonal behavior (TIB), whose functions are attitude, social factor, affect and habit. In the present paper, attitude is conceptualized by four predictors, namely confidence in driving, green environment, social responsibility and deviation in driving. The social factor is characterized by subjective norms, social status and digitalization. Affect factor is conceptualized by accidents and damages, road infrastructure, and weather conditions. The mental block in following the ancestor’s way of owning a personal vehicle is the predictor for the habit. Findings: One of the major contributors to environmental damages is road traffic. Notably, vehicle emissions are on the rise every year due to the increase of reliance on vehicles, and there is no alternative to this issue. Although Malaysia has a well-organized infrastructure with effective digitalized technology on the road for the transport system, there is severe traffic congestion in Klang Valley, Kuala Lumpur, because of a lack of travel plan behavior during peak hours. If the road commuters give the predictors constructed in the proposed conceptual framework the highest importance, then there will be much relief to traffic congestion on the road. Research limitations/implications: Since the present study focuses on the conceptualization of an urban travel behavior model (UTBM), and also highlights the synchronization of the proposed framework with the management theory, the results are expected after the primary survey based on the cross-sectional study will be conducted. Originality/value: The identification of the suitable predictors for the UTBM toward the travel behavior performance of a commuter is the real novelty of the present study. Also, the cause and effect relationships of different predictors in terms of path directions of the proposed research framework are the highlights of the study. Further, the predictors in the proposed framework and the TIB have been synchronized with operational definitions, which are the original contributions of the present study, which will enhance the sustainable environmental development for the society as a whole. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Green environment; Malaysia; Mental block; Road traffic policies/regulations; Urban travel behaviour,Klang Valley; Malaysia; West Malaysia; air quality; atmospheric pollution; carbon emission; carbon monoxide; conceptual framework; pollution monitoring; sustainable development; travel behavior; urban transport,,Scopus,"Conceptualization of an urban travel behavior model to mitigate air pollution for sustainable environmental development in Malaysia Purpose: Global issues on the environment, such as climate change, air pollution and carbon monoxide emission, are the primary concerns in any part of the world.

As a result, persons living in socially disadvantaged communities may experience disproportionate health risks from environmental exposures. Mixed methods research can be used to understand community-level and individual-level exposures to chemical and nonchemical stressors contributing to environmental health disparities. Furthermore, community-based participatory research (CBPR) approaches can lead to more effective interventions.OBJECTIVES: We applied mixed methods to identify environmental health perceptions and needs among metal recyclers and residents living in disad-vantaged neighborhoods near metal recycling facilities in Houston, Texas, in a CBPR study, Metal Air Pollution Partnership Solutions (MAPPS). Informed by what we learned and our previous findings from cancer and noncancer risk assessments of metal air pollution in these neighborhoods, we developed an action plan to lower metal aerosol emissions from metal recycling facilities and enhance community capacity to address environ-mental health risks.METHODS: Key informant interviews, focus groups, and community surveys were used to identify environmental health concerns of residents.

However, achieving exclusive LPG use in households unaccustomed to this type of fuel, used in combination with a new stove technology, requires substantial behaviour change. We conducted theory-grounded formative research to identify contextual factors influencing cooking fuel choice to guide the development of behavioural strategies for the Household Air Pollution Intervention Network (HAPIN) trial. The HAPIN trial will assess the impact of exclusive LPG use on air pollution exposure and health of pregnant women, older adult women, and infants under 1 year of age in Guatemala, India, Peru, and Rwanda. Methods Using the Capability, Opportunity, Motivation-Behaviour (COM-B) framework and Behaviour Change Wheel (BCW) to guide formative research, we conducted in-depth interviews, focus group discussions, observations, key informant interviews and pilot studies to identify key influencers of cooking behaviours in the four countries. We used these findings to develop behavioural strategies likely to achieve exclusive LPG use in the HAPIN trial. Results We identified nine potential influencers of exclusive LPG use, including perceived disadvantages of solid fuels, family preferences, cookware, traditional foods, non-food-related cooking, heating needs, LPG awareness, safety and cost and availability of fuel. Mapping formative findings onto the theoretical frameworks, behavioural strategies for achieving exclusive LPG use in each research site included free fuel deliveries, locally acceptable stoves and equipment, hands-on training and printed materials and videos emphasising relevant messages. In the HAPIN trial, we will monitor and reinforce exclusive LPG use through temperature data loggers, LPG fuel delivery tracking, in-home observations and behavioural reinforcement visits.

To examine Beijing residents’ protective behavioral intentions against smog, we proposed a conceptual model, which applies the health belief model (HBM) and specifies the roles of three distal predictors: exposure to news, discussion, and worry. The proposed model was tested in the context of protective behavioral intentions (i.e., intention to wear facemask & intention to use air purifier). Data were collected from Beijing residents during the period from 2/27 to 3/7 in 2017. Structural-equation-modeling (SEM) analyses of valid cases (N = 523) found support for the health belief model regarding the positive effects of perceived threat, perceived benefit, and perceived self-efficacy on intention to wear facemask or intention to use air purifier. Perceived barrier has a negative effect on intention to use air purifier, but is not related to intention to wear facemask. Neither exposure nor discussion is related to perceived threat. The effect of worry on intention to wear facemaskor intention to use air purifier is mediated by perceived threat. This proposed mediating mechanism is superior to the reverse mechanism (that worry mediates perceived threat).

It presented numerous pieces of evidence that affect health-related adverse effects causing diseases and even death and the development of technology has helped monitor the exposure of people to air pollution. This research analyzed factors affecting the perceived usability of air pollution detection on the 'AirVisual' mobile application based on the integrated model of Protection Motivation Theory (PMT) and Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT2). A total of 416 participants voluntarily answered a self-administered survey consisting of adapted constructs covering factors such as Performance expectancy (PE), Effort expectancy (EE), Social influence (SI), Facilitating conditions (FC), Habit (HB), Perceived risk (PR), Perceived trust (PT), Intention to use (IU), and Perceived usability (PU). Structural Equation Modeling and Random Forest Classifier were utilized to determine factors affecting perceived usability of the 'AirVisual' mobile application.

Assessing the public's knowledge about air quality is critical to calibrate public health interventions. However, previous efforts to measure knowledge about air quality (AQIQ) have not relied on consistent and validated measures, thus precluding cross-country comparisons. We aimed to develop a robust scale to assess AQIQ and tested it in multiple countries. Methods: To evaluate the psychometric properties and select the best performing items out of 10 AQIQ questions, we used methods from classical test theory and item response theory. We evaluated the scales using several scalability measures, including the Kuder-Richardson Formula 20 (KR-20), Loevinger's H, as well as trace lines. Volunteers from the United States (US, n = 400), India (n = 403), and China (n = 443) were recruited to validate the scale. Multiple linear regression was used to estimate the association between demographic factors and AQIQ. Results: We found that participants from India had the highest AQIQ. In addition, not all questions performed well in each country. The scale was pruned and shorter subscales were validated. In the US, we obtained a 4-item scale (KR20 = 0.53, Loevinger's H = 0.34). In India, we obtained a 6-item scale (KR20 = 0.56; Loevinger's H = 0.48 for just 2 items). In China, we obtained a 5-item scale (KR20 = 0.39; Loevinger's H = 0.41 for just 2 items). Compared to the 10-item scale, the pruned scales showed stronger associations between measures of socioeconomic status and AQIQ. The results were robust to the scale used. Conclusions: Overall, general knowledge questions measured AQIQ more effectively in the US and India whereas knowledge of the air quality index better measured AQIQ in China.

The theory of planned behavior and the Fogg behavior model was employed in this study. The online survey was administered to university students in Thailand. The authors compared the haze’s influence in the individual context, which is directly relevant to, and under the control of, the youth and in the collective context in which the youth has to rely on others to perform pro-environmental behavior. SEM techniques were used to analyze the relationship between constructs in the research model and to compare the results between the individual context and the collective context. The findings showed that, in the individual context, the fear of the consequence and the belief in the connection between the haze and environmental degradation stimulate an environmentally concerned attitude. This concern, as well as the social norm and perceived behavior control, affect intention and behavior to save the environment. However, the role of the collective context in observing the impact of haze is more complex. Social norms and perceived behavior control, as well as the perceived effect of smog and perceived connection between the haze incidence and the degradation, have to operate cohesively to persuade the youth to participate in collective activities to solve collective problems. © 2020 by ASERS® Publishing.

194,10.3390/ijerph14121559,Do Individual and Neighborhood Characteristics Influence Perceived Air Quality?,"Deguen, S; Padilla, M; Padilla, C; Kihal-Talantikite, W",2017,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH,14,12,"Background: Despite improvements, air pollution still remains a major public health issue. Numerous epidemiological studies have demonstrated the adverse health effects of air pollution exposure based on modeled measures, but only a few have considered the health impact of perceived air quality. Improving our knowledge of individual perceptions is crucial to defining targeted actions and promoting appropriate intervention measures. Our objective is to investigate the relationship between subjective and objective measures of air pollution and to focus on how individual characteristics combined with the neighborhood socioeconomic deprivation index, measured at a fine spatial scale, may or may not alter this relationship. Materials and Methods: The subjective measures of air quality reported by a sample of Lyon residents were collected via an individual questionnaire. The objective measures of air pollution were modeled by the local air quality monitoring network of the Rhone-Alpes region at census block level. We used a socioeconomic deprivation index to capture the different socioeconomic dimensions at census block level. The statistical analysis was structured in two steps: (1) identification of individual determinants of the subjective measures of air quality using multiple correspondence analysis followed by hierarchical clustering; (2) identification of individual and contextual characteristics that may alter the relationship between the objective and subjective measures of air pollution. Results: Among the youngest and the middle aged population (ages 30 to 59), consistent results between level of satisfaction, perceived air quality and objective measures of air pollution were found whatever the individual characteristics of the population. It is less clear among the oldest population: globally no significant difference between the NO2 concentrations and the level of satisfaction was observed. Conclusions: We found a significant relationship between the subjective and objective measures of air pollution in many population sub-groups with different combinations of individual characteristics. The relationship is less clear among the oldest population, which confirms previous findings. Our finding highlights that age combined with low level of education and unemployment, or women or health problems as well as the neighborhood deprivation index influence the level of air quality satisfaction.",air pollution; perception; public health,Adult; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Environmental Exposure; Environmental Monitoring; Female; Humans; Middle Aged; Perception; Residence Characteristics; Young Adult; France; Lyons; Rhone; Rhone-Alpes; air quality; atmospheric pollution; health impact; neighborhood; perception; pollution effect; pollution exposure; public health; adult; aged; air monitoring; air pollution; air quality; Article; education; female; human; male; neighborhood; noise pollution; questionnaire; satisfaction; socioeconomics; statistical analysis; traffic; unemployment; air pollutant; air pollution; analysis; chemistry; demography; environmental exposure; environmental monitoring; middle aged; perception; young adult,LONG-TERM EXPOSURE; ANNOYANCE SCORES; NITROGEN-DIOXIDE; LUNG-CANCER; POLLUTION; MORTALITY; HEALTH; PERCEPTION; POLLUTANTS; BEHAVIOR,WOS,"Do Individual and Neighborhood Characteristics Influence Perceived Air Quality?

Our objective is to investigate the relationship between subjective and objective measures of air pollution and to focus on how individual characteristics combined with the neighborhood socioeconomic deprivation index, measured at a fine spatial scale, may or may not alter this relationship. Materials and Methods: The subjective measures of air quality reported by a sample of Lyon residents were collected via an individual questionnaire. The objective measures of air pollution were modeled by the local air quality monitoring network of the Rhone-Alpes region at census block level. We used a socioeconomic deprivation index to capture the different socioeconomic dimensions at census block level. The statistical analysis was structured in two steps: (1) identification of individual determinants of the subjective measures of air quality using multiple correspondence analysis followed by hierarchical clustering; (2) identification of individual and contextual characteristics that may alter the relationship between the objective and subjective measures of air pollution. Results: Among the youngest and the middle aged population (ages 30 to 59), consistent results between level of satisfaction, perceived air quality and objective measures of air pollution were found whatever the individual characteristics of the population. It is less clear among the oldest population: globally no significant difference between the NO2 concentrations and the level of satisfaction was observed. Conclusions: We found a significant relationship between the subjective and objective measures of air pollution in many population sub-groups with different combinations of individual characteristics. The relationship is less clear among the oldest population, which confirms previous findings. Our finding highlights that age combined with low level of education and unemployment, or women or health problems as well as the neighborhood deprivation index influence the level of air quality satisfaction. air pollution; perception; public health Adult; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Environmental Exposure; Environmental Monitoring; Female; Humans; Middle Aged; Perception; Residence Characteristics; Young Adult; France; Lyons; Rhone; Rhone-Alpes; air quality; atmospheric pollution; health impact; neighborhood; perception; pollution effect; pollution exposure; public health; adult; aged; air monitoring; air pollution; air quality; Article; education; female; human; male; neighborhood; noise pollution; questionnaire; satisfaction; socioeconomics; statistical analysis; traffic; unemployment; air pollutant; air pollution; analysis; chemistry; demography; environmental exposure; environmental monitoring; middle aged; perception; young adult LONG-TERM EXPOSURE; ANNOYANCE SCORES; NITROGEN-DIOXIDE; LUNG-CANCER; POLLUTION; MORTALITY; HEALTH; PERCEPTION; POLLUTANTS; BEHAVIOR","```json

In this study, we surveyed 1236 Chinese online customers to explore the influence of air pollution perception on climate change perception and willingness to pay (WTP) for supporting climate actions. Structural equation modeling results revealed that higher air pollution perception, which is connected to an individual's living environment and health status, is significantly associated with higher climate change perception.

According to our research, when a higher pollution level is announced, people's pollution perception expressed online rises by 3.5%–3.7%, which is approximately equivalent to the response to a more than 100 Air Quality Index (AQI) increase. The episode-based analyses reveal that the impact of pollution level information would fade away along with the persistence or the frequency of the announced pollution episode, which shows a phenomenon of information fatigue. The heterogeneity analyses reveal that the impact of pollution level is significant only when the original pollution level is “Good” or “Lightly Polluted”, leading to an increase of pollution perception by 2.8% and 4.8%, respectively.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of steam air humidification on SBS and perceived air quality during the heating season. The study base consisted of a dynamic population of 104 hospital employees, working in four new and well geriatric hospital units in Sweden. Air humidification raised the relative air humidity to 40-45% in two units during a four months period, whereas the other two units served as controls with relative humidity from 25-35%. Symptoms and perceived indoor ah quality were measured before and after the study period by a standardised self administered questionnaire. The technical measurements comprised room temperature, air humidity, static electricity, exhaust air flow, aerosols, microorganisms, and volatile organic compounds in the air. The most pronounced effect of the humidification was a significant decrease of the sensation of air dryness, static electricity, and airway symptoms. After four months of air humidification during the heating season, 24% reported a weekly sensation of dryness in humidified units, compared with 73% in controls.

We spend the majority of our lives indoors and can be exposed to a number of pollutants smaller than 2.5 microns (particulate matter, PM2.5) resulting in detrimental health effects. Indoor air quality sensors have the potential to provide people with the information they need to understand their risk and take steps to reduce their exposure. One such sensor is the Speck sensor developed at the Community Robotics, Education and Technology Empowerment Lab at Carnegie Mellon University. This sensor provides users with continuous real-time and historical PM2.5 information, a Web-based platform where people can track their PM2.5 levels over time and learn about ways to reduce their exposure, and a venue (blog post) for the user community to exchange information. Little is known about how the use of such monitors affects people's knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors with respect to indoor air pollution. Objective: The aim of this study was to assess whether using the sensor changes what people know and do about indoor air pollution. Methods: We conducted 2 studies. In the first study, we recruited 276 Pittsburgh residents online and through local branches of the Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh, where the Speck sensor was made available by the researchers in the library catalog. Participants completed a 10- to 15-min survey on air pollution knowledge (its health impact, sources, and mitigation options), perceptions of indoor air quality, confidence in mitigation, current behaviors toward air quality, and personal empowerment and creativity in the spring and summer of 2016.

Results: A series of paired t tests found participants were significantly more knowledgeable (t(25)=-2.61, P=.02), reported having significantly better indoor air quality (t(25)=-5.20, P<.001), and felt more confident about knowing how to mitigate their risk (t(25)=-1.87, P=.07) after using the Speck sensor than before.

The aim of this study was to investigate an extended parallel process model (EPPM)-based mobile phone text message intervention for improving protective behaviors against air pollution among pregnant women. In this randomized controlled trial (IRCT2016102810804N8), 130 pregnant women were randomly assigned into either experimental or control groups. A valid and reliable questionnaire was used to collect data. Experimental group received mobile phone intervention on a daily basis for 2 months. Control group received usual care, only. Data were analyzed using SPSS 15 applying t test, chi-square, and Wilcoxon and Mann-Whitney U test. Although before intervention, there were no significant differences between different structures of EPPM (P > 0.05), after intervention, there were statistically significant differences between perceived severity, response efficacy, self-efficacy, and protective behaviors between two groups (P < 0.05).

The aim of this study was to investigate an extended parallel process model (EPPM)-based mobile phone text message intervention for improving protective behaviors against air pollution among pregnant women. In this randomized controlled trial (IRCT2016102810804N8), 130 pregnant women were randomly assigned into either experimental or control groups. A valid and reliable questionnaire was used to collect data. Experimental group received mobile phone intervention on a daily basis for 2 months. Control group received usual care, only. Data were analyzed using SPSS 15 applying t test, chi-square, and Wilcoxon and Mann-Whitney U test. Although before intervention, there were no significant differences between different structures of EPPM (P > 0.05), after intervention, there were statistically significant differences between perceived severity, response efficacy, self-efficacy, and protective behaviors between two groups (P < 0.05).

The aims of this case study were to investigate the functionality of a supply air fan-assisted hybrid ventilation system in a newly built school building with reported IAQ problems and to determine the effects of ventilation improvement on measured and perceived IAQ. The ventilation system function was researched simultaneously with IAQ measurements, with an analysis of total volatile organic compounds (TVOC), single volatile organic compounds (VOCs), and indoor mycobiota, and with questionnaires about perceived IAQ. At the baseline, an operational error of the ventilation system was found, which prevented the air from coming into the classrooms, except for short periods of high carbon dioxide (CO2) concentrations.

This study examined the effects of air pollutants (ozone (O-3), sulphur dioxide (SO2), and nitrogen dioxide (NO2)) on the searching behaviour of insect parasitoids. A series of experiments comprising short-term, closed chamber fumigations of O-3, SO2, and NO2 (100 nl 1(-1)) of the braconid parasitoid (Asobara tabida) and aggregated distributions of its host larvae (Drosophila subobscura) was set up. Analysis of chamber results showed that the proportion of hosts parasitised and the searching efficiency of the parasitoids were both significantly reduced with O-3 fumigation, but not with NO2 or SO2 fumigations. O-3 fumigation reduced percentage parasitism by approximately 10%. Parasitoids were able to avoid patches with no hosts, both in filtered air controls and when exposed to pollutants. However in the O-3 and NO2 treatments they appeared less able to discriminate between different host densities, suggesting that pollutants may interfere with the olfactory responses of the parasitoids.

We aimed to investigate the effects of prenatal exposure to AP on lateral ventricles (LV) and corpus callosum (CC) volumes in children and to determine whether the induced brain changes are associated with behavioral problems. Methods: Among the children recruited through a set of representative schools of the city of Barcelona, (Spain) in the Brain Development and Air Pollution Ultrafine Particles in School Children (BREATHE) study, 186 typically developing participants aged 8-12 years underwent brain MRI on the same 1.5 T MR unit over a 1.5-year period (October 2012-April 2014). Brain volumes were derived from structural MRI scans using automated tissue segmentation. Behavioral problems were assessed using the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) and the criteria of the Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder DSM-IV list. Prenatal fine particle (PM2.5) levels were retrospectively estimated at the mothers' residential addresses during pregnancy with land use regression (LUR) models. To determine whether brain structures might be affected by prenatal PM2.5 exposure, linear regression models were run and adjusted for age, sex, intracranial volume (ICV), maternal education, home socioeconomic vulnerability index, birthweight and mothers' smoking status during pregnancy. To test for associations between brain changes and behavioral outcomes, negative binomial regressions were performed and adjusted for age, sex, ICV. Results: Prenatal PM2.5 levels ranged from 11.8 to 39.5 mu g/m(3) during the third trimester of pregnancy. An interquartile range increase in PM2.5 level (7 mu g/m(3)) was significantly linked to a decrease in the body CC volume (mm(3)) (beta = -53.7, 95%CI [-92.0, -15.5] corresponding to a 5% decrease of the mean body CC volume) independently of ICV, age, sex, maternal education, socioeconomic vulnerability index at home, birthweight and mothers smoking status during the third trimester of pregnancy.

A parallel set of experiments assessed the effects of VR per unit floor area on the same outcomes. Sixteen blinded healthy young adult subjects participated in each study. Each exposure lasted four hours and each subject experienced two conditions in a within-subject study design. The order of presentation of test conditions, day of testing, and gender were balanced. Temperature, relative humidity, VRs, and concentrations of pollutants were monitored. Online surveys assessed PAQ and SBS symptoms and a validated computer-based tool measured decision-making performance. Neither changing the VR per person nor changing the VR per floor area, had consistent statistically significant effects on PAQ or SBS symptoms. However, reductions in either occupant-based VR or floor-area-based VR had a significant and independent negative impact on most decision-making measures.

A parallel set of experiments assessed the effects of VR per unit floor area on the same outcomes. Sixteen blinded healthy young adult subjects participated in each study. Each exposure lasted four hours and each subject experienced two conditions in a within-subject study design. The order of presentation of test conditions, day of testing, and gender were balanced. Temperature, relative humidity, VRs, and concentrations of pollutants were monitored. Online surveys assessed PAQ and SBS symptoms and a validated computer-based tool measured decision-making performance. Neither changing the VR per person nor changing the VR per floor area, had consistent statistically significant effects on PAQ or SBS symptoms. However, reductions in either occupant-based VR or floor-area-based VR had a significant and independent negative impact on most decision-making measures. These results indicate that the changes in VR employed in the study influence performance of healthy young adults even when PAQ and SBS symptoms are unaffected.

This study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of an educational intervention within a cardiac rehabilitation (CR) context in enhancing patients' understanding of air pollution and its cardiovascular effects.Methods A pre-post pilot study was conducted from February 2021 to June 2021 at the Gregorio Mara & ntilde;& oacute;n University General Hospital, Madrid, Spain. A total of 43 patients with cardiovascular disease attending CR were enrolled. Participants received a 1-h educational intervention delivered either in-person or online, focusing on the effects of air pollution and strategies to reduce exposure. Pre- and post-intervention questionnaires assessed participants' knowledge and perceptions. Descriptive statistics were used to analyze changes in awareness and understanding.Results Initially, participants demonstrated a high level of awareness about the health impacts of air pollution, with 100% acknowledging its effects on health. However, detailed knowledge about specific concepts such as the Air Quality Index (AQI) and particulate matter (PM2.5) was limited. Post-intervention, there was a significant increase in knowledge, with familiarity with AQI rising from 61% to 81% (p = 0.02) and understanding of PM2.5 improving from 28% to 58% (p = 0.01). This indicates that the educational intervention effectively bridged gaps in understanding and reinforced the importance of environmental factors in cardiovascular health management.Discussion The pilot study highlights the critical role of targeted education in improving patient awareness and knowledge about air pollution.

229,10.1097/PHH.0000000000000613,Estimating the Public Health Impact of Air Pollution for Informing Policy in the Twin Cities: A Minnesota Tracking Collaboration,"Johnson, JE; Bael, DL; Sample, JM; Lindgren, PG; Kvale, DL",2017,JOURNAL OF PUBLIC HEALTH MANAGEMENT AND PRACTICE,23,5,"Objective: The Minnesota Department of Health and the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency used local air pollution and public health data to estimate the impacts of particulate matter and ozone on population health, to identify disparities, and to inform decisions that will improve health. Setting: While air quality in Minnesota currently meets federal standards, urban communities are concerned about the impact of air pollution on their health. The Twin Cities (Minneapolis-St Paul) metropolitan area includes 7 counties where fine particulate levels and rates of asthma exacerbations are elevated in some communities. Design: We used the Environmental Protection Agency's BenMAP (Environmental Benefits Mapping and Analysis Program) software, along with local PM2.5 (fine particulate) and ozone ambient concentrations, census and population health data, to calculate impacts for 2008 at the zip code level. The impacts were summed across all zip codes for area-wide estimates. American Community Survey data were used to stratify zip codes by poverty and race for assessment of disparities. Main Outcome Measures: Attributable fraction, attributable rate and counts for all-cause mortality, asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease hospitalizations, asthma emergency department (ED) visits, and cardiovascular disease hospitalizations. Results: In the Twin Cities (2008), air pollution was a contributing cause for an estimated 2% to 5% of respiratory and cardiovascular hospitalizations and ED visits and between 6% and 13% of premature deaths. The elderly (aged 65+ years) experienced the highest air pollution-attributable rates of death and respiratory hospitalizations; children experienced the highest asthma ED visit rates. Geographical and demographic differences in air pollution-attributable health impacts across the region reflected the differences in the underlying morbidity and mortality rates. Conclusions: Method was effective in demonstrating that changes in air quality can have quantifiable health impacts across the Twin Cities. Key messages and implications from this work were shared with the media, community groups, legislators and the public.

The present study attempts to clarify physicians’ moral responsibility in this regard and the roles they can play to decrease environmental problems. It also evaluates their attitudes towards and performance of these roles. The clarification of this issue paves the way for interventions through effective education or policy-making, as well as directing useful research. Materials and methods: A questionnaire was developed based on the results of qualitive study. The questionnaire assessed physicians’ awareness, attitude, and performance with regard to their environmental moral responsibilities. Results: Physicians with longer work experience had better performance. Those who worked in offices or at universities had also better performances compared to those working in hospitals. Physicians with more awareness had better performance, especially those who had acquired this awareness through books and educational workshops. The source of information was an effective factor on the gap between physicians’ attitude and performance scores those who had acquired information from books had the narrowest gap and those who had received information from social networks had the widest gap between attitude and performance scores.

233,,Evaluation of BTEX concentration and indoor air quality perceptions in platforms and train,Ya'acob S.H.; Saidin N.S.; Sukri N.S.; Sahani M.,2015,,10.0,20,"Benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene and xylene (BTEX) are compounds that are harmful to health and it exists in the public transportation environment including the railway transportation. This study was conducted to determine the concentration of BTEX in the train and the platform of a railway service provider. Air sampling was conducted to compare the concentrations of BTEX in the train and platform by using activated charcoal sorbent tubes for one hour at Sentul- Klang route during peak hours. Analysis of air samples was done by using Gas Chromatography-Flame Ionization Detector (GC-FID). In addition, questionnaires were distributed to 254 respondents by cluster sampling on weekdays to examine passengers' perception on the indoor air quality (IAQ) of trains and platforms. The results indicated that 70.5% of passengers are aged 21-30 years, 11.8% aged 31-40 years, 10.6% aged 51 years and over, 5.5% aged 41-50 years and 1.6% aged 20 years and less. Majority of the passengers perceived the density of passengers on trains as dense (63.0%) and platform as less dense (49.2%). Passengers mostly feel that ventilation (57.9%), wind quality (66.9%) and IAQ (57.9%) are acceptable in the train. In the platform, passengers mostly choose an acceptable answer to the perception of ventilation (64.6%), air quality (63.0%) and IAQ (70.5%). There were no significant differences in comparison of IAQ in the train and platform by passengers' age range (p>0.05). There is a significant correlation between IAQ and passenger density, ventilation, odor and air quality in the train (p<0.01). However, a significant correlation was only found between IAQ and ventilation and air quality in the platform (p<0.01) and no significant correlation was found between IAQ and the passenger density on the platform (p>0.01).

Water boiling and cooking experiments using the common cooking energy sources (fuel wood, kerosene, liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) and electricity) and common food items (water, yam and beans) were carried out. Energy surveys were carried out to determine the cooking energy use patterns in the urban and rural areas. It was found that fuel wood is the least expensive cooking energy source and LPG is the most expensive. Energy use efficiencies for boiling water were estimated at 25%, 46%, 73%, 79%, 66% and 90% for fuel wood, kerosene, gas, electric immersion coil, electric heating coil and electric hot plate, respectively. Energy intensity was found to be a comparative measure of energy efficiency. The impacts of air pollution from household cooking suggested a possibility of significant air pollutants contribution to the ambient environment using any of the energy carriers considered except electricity.

Increasing attention from the news media, new health data, and public debate over the effectiveness of clean air regulations have raised the importance of air quality in the public consciousness. While public perceptions of air quality have been studied thoroughly dating back to the 1960s, little empirical research has been conducted to explain the spatial aspects of these perceptions, particularly at the local level. Although recent studies suggest characteristics of local setting are important in shaping perceptions of air quality, the roles of proximity, neighborhood characteristics, and location have not been clarified. This study seeks to improve understanding of the major factors shaping public perceptions of air quality by examining the spatial pattern of local risk perception, the role of socioeconomic characteristics in forming these perceptions, and the relationship between perceived and scientifically measured air pollution. First, we map the spatial pattern of local air quality perceptions using Geographic Information Systems (GIS) across the Dallas and Houston metropolitan areas. Next, we explain these perceptions through local contextual factors using both bivariate correlations and multivariate regression analysis. Results indicate that perceptions of air quality in the study areas are not significantly correlated with air quality based on readings of air monitoring stations. Instead, perceptions appear to be influenced by setting (urban vs. rural), state identification, access to information, and socioeconomic characteristics such as age, race, and political identification.

However, an alternative to the management of IAQ is possible through environmental behavioral change.Research Methodology: A philosophical stance of post-positivism influences the adoption of a quantitative research approach for this study. Primary data on the views shared by various academic and administrative staff employed by HEIs across South Africa were collected using a closed-ended questionnaire survey. A literature review uncovered 16 influential environmental policy adoption enablers that could further the objective of the study. A four-phase data analytical approach was adopted to interpret the empirical data through screening and reliability assessment, together with descriptive and inferential statistical evaluations, to ascertain the influence held by the surveyed policy adoption enablers on improving the management of IAQ in HEIs.Results: The inferential statistical evaluation using exploratory factor analysis revealed three crucial environmental policy adoption metrical approaches (stakeholder dialogue, institutional commitment, and policy composition) to the management of IAQ in HEIs.Discussion: From a practical perspective, the administrative council of HEIs could consider the identified policy adoption enablers as a catalyst for pro-environmental behavior and the management of IAQ in all respective institutions. Theoretically, this study contributes to the body of knowledge by providing factors associated with environmental policy adoptions for IAQ management and laying the groundwork for future research in environmental behavior, this has been lacking in previous IAQ studies and current environmental management discourse.

A detailed questionnaire developed for this purpose was administered to 95 final year students attending at the Department of Interior Architecture and Environmental Design of Atilim University, Hacettepe University and Selcuk University. In conclusion, the study found that the participants had insufficient knowledge on the pollutants released by the interior equipment elements and that knowledge level of the participant students differed depending on the attended university.

The present study focuses on two types of resident vehicular PM2.5 reduction behaviors (taking public transportation and purchasing electric vehicles) and examines their key predictors and influencing mechanism based on the extended Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB). The data was collected from Chinese urban residents who lived in heavy haze areas. The results indicated that attitude, subjective norm and moral norm have positive effects on each vehicular PM2.5 reduction intention. It was highlighted that the differentiated perceived behavioral control components (self-efficacy and perceived control) and their moderating effects were inconsistent across two behaviors.

However, the damage from air pollution on pregnant women's mental health has not been fully discussed. A case-control study was conducted to evaluate the effects of PM2.5 exposure and risk perception on the mental stress of pregnant women. A total of 605 pregnant women, including 403 high symptoms of stress cases and 202 matched controls, were recruited from January 2018 to December 2018 in Nanjing, among which 313 high symptoms of stress cases and 144 matched controls were included in the analysis. Meaningfully high symptoms of anxiety were defined with a score of 6 points or greater on the phobic anxiety subscale of the Crown-Crisp index. We found that the PM2.5 effect perceived by the case group was significantly higher than the control group, and the PM2.5 exposure of the case group was also significantly higher than that of the control group. Binary logistic regression showed that for each increase in unit of PM2.5 exposure, the risk of pregnant women suffering from high mental stress increased by 13.76% (95 %CI: 8.26–19.53%). Through path analysis modeling, we found that in the case group, perceived indoor attributions not only had a direct impact on mental stress (p < 0.001), but also played a key mediating role in the impact of average daily dose of PM2.5 on mental stress (p < 0.001). The high level of mental stress is not only affected by objective exposure, but also by subjective perceptions in the case group. Considering the significant effect of PM2.5 exposure on mental stress, pregnant women are recommended to spend appropriate amounts of time outdoors during clean air days.

However, in many cases, land use planning and park design do not consider the relationship between the park location, its shape and size, and distance to the main road, traffic, and air pollution, which may expose residents using the park to the risks of air pollution. Meanwhile, existing research has paid less attention to the air pollution of green park spaces, especially at the neighborhood level. Based on air pollution monitoring and survey data, this study explored the spatial characteristics of air pollution in 33 neighborhood parks in the central urban area of Guangzhou, China, as well as the influencing factors, and residents' perception of air pollution when using the neighborhood park. The main conclusions are the following: 1) The air pollution exposure risks and their spatial pattern distribution in neighborhood parks in various districts are quite different, and the proportion of parks with low exposure risk is relatively small; 2) the Air Quality Index (AQI), PM1.0, and PM10 are significantly negatively associated with the area of neighborhood parks, while AQI, PM1.0, PM10, and PM2.5 are significantly positively associated with the patch shape index. In addition, the carbon dioxide (CO2) index is significantly negatively associated only with the distance from the urban main roads. However, there is almost no correlation between primary and secondary road density within the 1 km buffer zone of the neighborhood boundary and the degree of air pollution. 3) More than one-third of the residents' subjective perception of the air pollution level is better than the objective measurement, which indicates that they overestimated the air quality of the neighborhood park. This may have possibly led them to more exposure to the bad air environment when they do some physical activities there. When there are possible traffic pollution sources around neighborhood parks, residents' subjective perceptions of air quality are low. 4) Alternative activity spaces and accessibility of neighborhood parks affect the risk of residents' exposure to air pollution. If there is no alternative activity space around the residence, or the nearest neighborhood park is more accessible, residents would be more inclined to head to the neighborhood park for physical activity, even if they perceive the risk of air pollution exposure. In addition, this study has some policy insights. Neighborhood parks can help to suppress the diffusion of particulate matter, but most of them are small and have limited effects on mitigating traffic air pollution. To maximize the ecological service function of neighborhood parks and their role in air pollution purification, neighborhood parks covering larger areas, having higher accessibility and fuller shapes, and being far away from main traffic roads should be promoted. It is necessary to implement targeted space optimization and air pollution control strategies, such as control traffic around neighborhood parks with more serious air pollution; increase protective green spaces, the number of street trees, and road greening; optimize building planning and layout; and improve non-motorized travel environments. © 2021 Editorial Committee of Tropical Geography.

In traditional exposure research, air pollution and noise are monitored with stationary measurement devices or based on models. During the last years, mobile measurement techniques with GPS-tracking have increased. Moreover, studies have investigated another dimension of personal exposure: the perceived exposure. Aim: Most of these studies make use of quantitative methods such as surveys, complemented by stationary or wearable sensors. Little research exist that applies qualitative methods to examine how people experience and perceive exposure on-the-move, contrasting it to actual measurements. The aim of this paper is to discuss the potential of a novel method, which extends the dimensions of personal exposure by including the situational context of exposure perception. Methods/case study: Firstly, different methods for exposure research are presented. Secondly, we introduce a novel mixed-method approach, exploring cyclists and pedestrians perceived and measured exposure on-the-move by combining mobile interviews (Go-/Ride-Alongs) and wearable sensors. We will present the methodological findings using a case study and have a quantitative method (smartphone questionnaire, wearable sensors) as a reference. Results and discussion: The differences of perceived and measured exposure, proven through the reference method, are a result of different situational contexts as shown by the mobile interviews (knowledge, embodied experience, life situation, activities). The methodological findings show, that mobile methods complemented by wearables introduce new dimensions of personal exposure: they shed light on the situational contexts that affect exposure perception during commute. Conclusion: We argue that both, perceived and measured exposure to air pollution and noise, need to be considered simultaneously.

Methods: A cross-sectional survey design was used. Data were collected from 150 voluntary older adult participants from Songpa-gu in Seoul. The survey questions measured service perception and experience related to PM, risk perception related to PM, attitude toward risk of PM, and health behavior related to PM. Results: The average score for health behavior related to PM was 79.37, ranging from 51 to 115. There was a significant positive correlation between health behavior related to PM and risk perception related to PM (r=.58, p<.001) as well as between health behavior related to PM and attitude toward risk of PM (r=.70, p<.001). Multiple linear regression revealed that health behavior related to PM was predicted by levels of the existence of disease related to PM (beta=.14, p=.019), service experience related to PM (beta=.20, p=.021), risk perception related to PM (beta=.20, p=.019), and attitude toward risk of PM (beta=.44, p<.001).

Exposure to haze is linked to ophthalmic, respiratory and cardiovascular diseases, and mortality. In this study, we investigated the role of demographic factors, knowledge and perceived risk in influencing protective behaviours during the 2013 haze in Singapore. Methods: We evaluated 696 adults in a cross-sectional study. Participants were sampled via a 2-stage simple random sampling without replacement from a large residential district in Singapore in 2015. The questionnaire measured the participant's knowledge, perceived risk and behaviours during the Southeast Asian haze crisis in 2013. Reliability and validity of the questionnaire were assessed using comparative fit index (>= 0.96) and root mean square error of approximation (<= 0.05). We performed structural equation modelling to examine the relationship between the hypothesised factors and protective behaviours. Results: More than 95% of the individuals engaged in at least 1 form of protective behaviour.

However, such studies focusing on hyperactive behaviors and susceptible window identification are currently lacking in China. Objectives: The study aims to explore the correlation between air pollution exposure and hyperactive behaviors during the early life stage and attempt to identify whether a susceptible exposure window exists that is crucial for further precise intervention. Methods: Based on the Longhua Child Cohort Study, we collected the basic information and hyperactivity index of 26,052 children using a questionnaire conducted from 2015 to 2017, and the Conners' Parent Rating Scale-revised (CPRS-48) was used to assess hyperactive behaviors.

Results show, as a whole, no straight-forward correlation between TGM and ozone concentrations. A significant correlation between TGM and water vapour mixing ratio was measured. Some back reduction of Hg(II) to Hg degrees in the aqueous phase and subsequent evaporation of Hg degrees according to Henry's Law is expected.

Surprisingly, there have been no studies of the differences in the public's willingness to pay (WTP) for haze governance within a province. Yet haze reduction policies are implemented at the provincial level. Based on the contingent valuation method, data on WTP for haze governance across four industrial cities in Shandong province were collected using a questionnaire survey. Method: A combination of stratified sampling and non-probability sampling methods were used, yielding a valid sample of 1006 respondents. The Heckman sample selection model was used to analyze factors determining WTP and WTP amount. Results: 53% of respondents were unwilling to pay for haze reduction, while less than 1% of these respondents were satisfied with Shandong's air quality. About half (47%) of the respondents were willing to pay, on average, US$14.14 per household per year for haze governance. We found that there were significant inter-city differences in the WTP and WTP amounts: those with a higher income, education, haze knowledge, and haze concern were WTP; age, marital status, and subjective indicators displayed a negative relationship with WTP amount. About two thirds of the non-payers, and those with poor environmental knowledge, argued that air quality improvement was mainly the responsibility of governments (39.3%) and polluters (25.6%), instead of ordinary citizens. Further, 27% of non-payers said that their income was too low to contribute to a pollution tax and 6.3% claimed that they did not believe the funds would be used effectively for environmental conservation.

270,10.1016/j.eneco.2019.104535,"Haze, health, and income: An integrated model for willingness to pay for haze mitigation in Shanghai, China","Ouyang, XL; Zhuang, WX; Sun, CW",2019,ENERGY ECONOMICS,84,,"Most existing studies indicate that residentso willingness to pay (WTP) for environmental protection mainly depends on income and the degree of environmental pollution. However, owing to lack of suitable data, less research has focused on why people have higher or lower WTP for environmental protection, and many questions about their reasons remain unanswered. Based on contingent valuation questionnaires in 16 districts of Shanghai, this study investigates the influencing factors of residentso WTP for haze mitigation. To avoid a multicollinearity problem, we integrate principal component analysis and the probit model to examine the determinants of WTP. Results show that residentso WTP for haze mitigation ranges from 343.31 to 359.48 USD. The major influencing factors of residentso WTP include subjective knowledge of haze impacts, understanding of the frequency and severity of haze, and social trust in haze data published by the government. In particular, we find that owing to anti-haze household expenditure on mitigating the effects of haze pollution on health, residents who considered that the areas they lived in were more influenced by haze pollution do not always have higher WTP for haze mitigation.

277,10.1016/j.ecolecon.2018.08.016,How Do Travellers Respond to Health and Environmental Policies to Reduce Air Pollution?,Orset C.,2019,,156.0,,"Despite the various measures taken to reduce air pollution in France, the French continue to use high-emission vehicles. We propose to evaluate the Willingness To Pay (WTP) for four means of transport: two high-emission vehicles (diesel taxi and diesel personal vehicle) and two low-emission vehicles (rented electric vehicle and public transport). Successive messages revealing the effects of air pollution on health and the environment are provided to individuals in a different order. The information conveyed changes both of the WTP of individuals and of their choices. However, the use of high-emission vehicles has not diminished, personal vehicles remain the most popular. Using data collected from our survey, a multinomial logit model is used to determine individual choices.

Despite the various measures taken to reduce air pollution in France, the French continue to use high-emission vehicles. We propose to evaluate the Willingness To Pay (WTP) for four means of transport: two high-emission vehicles (diesel taxi and diesel personal vehicle) and two low-emission vehicles (rented electric vehicle and public transport). Successive messages revealing the effects of air pollution on health and the environment are provided to individuals in a different order. The information conveyed changes both of the WTP of individuals and of their choices. However, the use of high-emission vehicles has not diminished, personal vehicles remain the most popular. Using data collected from our survey, a multinomial logit model is used to determine individual choices.

A review,"Riley, R; de Preux, L; Capella, P; Mejia, C; Kajikawa, Y; de Nazelle, A",2021,SUSTAINABILITY SCIENCE,16,6,"Solutions that engage the public are needed to tackle air pollution. Technological approaches are insufficient to bring urban air quality to recommended target levels, and miss out on opportunities to promote health more holistically through behavioural solutions, such as active travel. Behaviour change is not straightforward, however, and is more likely to be achieved when communication campaigns are based on established theory and evidence-based practices. We systematically reviewed the academic literature on air pollution communication campaigns aimed at influencing air pollution-related behaviour. Based on these findings, we developed an evidence-based framework for stimulating behaviour change through engagement. Across the 37 studies selected for analyses, we identified 28 different behaviours assessed using a variety of designs including natural and research-manipulated experiments, cross-sectional and longitudinal surveys and focus groups. While avoidance behaviour (e.g. reducing outdoor activity) followed by contributing behaviours (e.g. reducing idling) were by far the most commonly studied, supporting behaviour (e.g. civil engagement) shows promising results, with the added benefit that supporting local and national policies may eventually lead to the removal of social and physical barriers that prevent wider behavioural changes. Providing a range of actionable information will reduce disengagement due to feelings of powerlessness. Targeted localized information will appear more immediate and engaging, and positive framing will prevent cognitive dissonance whereby people rationalize their behaviour to avoid living with feelings of unease. Communicating the co-benefits of action may persuade individuals with different drivers but as an effective solution, it remains to be explored. Generally, finding ways to connect with people's emotions, including activating social norms and identities and creating a sense of collective responsibility, provide promising yet under-explored directions. Smartphones provide unique opportunities that enable flexible and targeted engagement, but care must be taken to avoid transferring responsibility for action from national and local authorities onto individuals.

Evidence from Beijing,"Zhao, PJ; Li, SX; Li, PL; Liu, JX; Long, KF",2018,TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART D-TRANSPORT AND ENVIRONMENT,63,,"It is widely believed air pollution is an obstacle to cycling as it has negative effects on cyclists' health outcomes and deteriorates their cycling experiences. However, the empirical studies investigating the impact of air pollution on cycling behaviour remains scarce. The aim of this paper is to fill the gap by looking at Beijing as a case study. The authors conducted a survey of 307 cyclists on the days with different levels of air quality in terms of concentration of PM2.5 in 2015. The results show that in the polluted weather, those who persist in cycling are more likely to be male, over 30 years old, lower income or those who travel short distances. Specifically, female cyclists have a higher tendency to shift from cycling to public transit than the males and medium and high-income earners are more likely to shift to using a car than low income earners. The residents' subjective perceptions of safety and comfort have major effects on their cycling behaviour. A higher perception of comfort and safety is related to a higher possibility of continuing cycling when air quality became polluted. Cycling for commuting trips is less likely to be replaced by other modes than cycling for non-commuting trips, such as shopping.

In recent years, the rapid development and expansion of low-cost air quality sensors by companies such as PurpleAir has enabled an understanding of air pollution at a much higher spatiotemporal resolution compared to traditional monitoring networks. In this study, real-time PM2.5 measurements from 751 PurpleAir sensors operating from June to July in 2019 and 2020 were used to examine the impact of 4th of July fireworks on hourly and daily PM2.5 concentrations at the census tract and county levels in California. American Community Survey (ACS) and CalEnviroScreen 3.0 data were used to identify correlations between PM2.5 measurements and socioeconomic status (SES). A two-step method was implemented to assure the quality of raw PM2.5 sensor data and sensor calibration against co-located reference instruments. The results showed that over 67% and 81% of counties experienced immediate impacts related to fireworks in 2019 and 2020, respectively. Relative to 2019, the peak PM2.5 concentrations on July 4th and 5th 2020 were, on average, over 50% higher in California, likely due to the COVID-19-related increase in the use of household-level fireworks. This increase was most pronounced in southern counties, which tend to have less strict firework-related regulations and a greater use of illegal fireworks. Los Angeles County experienced the highest July 4th daily PM2.5 levels both in 2019 (29.9 mu g center dot m(-3)) and 2020 (42.6 mu g center dot m(-3)). Spatial hot spot analyses generally showed these southern counties (e.g., Los Angeles County) to be regional air pollution hotspots, whereas the opposite pattern was seen in the north (e.g., San Francisco). The results also showed PM2.5 peaks that were over two-times higher among communities with lower SES, higher minority group populations, and higher asthma rates. Our findings highlight the important role that policy and enforcement can play in reducing firework-related air pollution and protecting public health, as exemplified by southern California, where policy was more relaxed and air pollution was higher (especially in 2020 when the 4th of July coincided with the COVID-19-lockdown period), and in disadvantaged communities where disparities were greatest.",air quality; firework; particulate matter; low-cost sensors; PurpleAir; Independence Day,Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Communicable Disease Control; COVID-19; Environmental Monitoring; Humans; Particulate Matter; Policy; San Francisco; SARS-CoV-2; California; United States; barium; chlorine; copper; magnesium; potassium; strontium; air quality; asthma; atmospheric pollution; concentration (composition); correlation; environmental justice; festival; particulate matter; policy approach; pollution monitoring; public health; socioeconomic status; spatiotemporal analysis; African American; air analysis; air pollution; air quality; American Indian; analytic method; Article; artificial neural network; Asian American; degradation; disease hotspot; environmental health; environmental management; environmental policy; environmental protection; ethnicity; health care policy; health survey; household; light scattering; operation duration; Pacific Ocean; particulate matter 2.5; PurpleAir sensor network; relative humidity; socioeconomics; spatial analysis; spatial hot spot analysis; spatiotemporal analysis; temporal analysis; United States; air pollutant; air pollution; California; communicable disease control; environmental monitoring; human; particulate matter; policy,AIR-POLLUTION; LOW-COST; PARTICULATE MATTER; SUBMICRON PARTICLES; FINE PARTICULATE; FIELD-EVALUATION; SHORT-TERM; COVID-19; QUALITY; HEALTH,WOS,"Impact of 4th of July Fireworks on Spatiotemporal PM2.5 Concentrations in California Based on the PurpleAir Sensor Network: Implications for Policy and Environmental Justice Fireworks are often used in celebration, causing short term, extremely high particulate matter air pollution.

Gaps in the scientific literature remain regarding the relationship between air pollution and sedentary behavior among young adults in China. The purpose of this study is to examine the effect of air pollution on sedentary behavior among college students living in Beijing, China. We conducted follow-up health surveys on 12,174 freshman students enrolled at Tsinghua University from 2013 to 2017. Sedentary behavior was measured using the short version of the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ). Corresponding air pollution data measured by the Ministry of Environmental Protection of the People's Republic of China were collected to include the average hourly air quality index (AQI), PM2.5, PM10, and NO2 (mu g/m(3)). The data were analyzed using linear individual fixed-effect regressions. An increase in air pollution concentration of one standard deviation in AQI, PM2.5, PM10, and NO2 was associated with an increase in weekly total hours of sedentary behavior by 7.35 (95% confidence interval (CI) = 5.89, 8.80), 6.24 (95% CI = 5.00, 7.49), 6.80 (95% CI = 5.46, 8.15), and 7.06 (95% CI = 5.65, 8.47), respectively.

This study examines the impact of ambient fine particulate matter (PM2.5) air pollution on health behaviors among college students in Beijing, China. Study design: Prospective cohort study. Methods: Health surveys were repeatedly administered among 12,000 newly admitted students at Tsinghua University during 2012-2015 over their freshman year. Linear individual fixed-effect regressions were performed to estimate the impacts of ambient PM2.5 concentration on health behaviors among survey participants, adjusting for various time-variant individual characteristics and environmental measures. Results: Ambient PM2.5 concentration was found to be negatively associated with time spent on walking, vigorous physical activity and sedentary behavior in the last week, but positively associated with time spent on nighttime/daytime sleep among survey participants. An increase in the ambient PM2.5 concentration by one standard deviation (36.5 mg/m(3)) was associated with a reduction in weekly total minutes of walking by 7.3 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 5.3-9.4), a reduction in weekly total minutes of vigorous physical activity by 10.1 (95% CI = 8.5-11.7), a reduction in daily average hours of sedentary behavior by 0.06 (95% CI = 0.02-0.10) but an increase in daily average hours of nighttime/daytime sleep by 1.07 (95% CI = 1.04-1.11).

To verify the feasibility and validity of industrial energy-saving and emission-reduction polices in-the action plan, we conducted a cost-benefit analysis of implementing these policies in 31 provinces for the period of 2013 to 2017. We also completed a scenario analysis in, this study to assess the cost-effectiveness of different measures within the energy-saving and the emission-reduction policies individually. The data were derived from field surveys, statistical yearbooks, government documents, and published literatures. The results show that total cost and total benefit are 118.39 and 748.15 billion Yuan, respectively, and the estimated benefit-cost ratio is 632 in the S3 scenario. For all the scenarios, these policies are cost-effective and the eastern region has higher satisfactory values. Furthermore, the end-of-pipe scenario has greater emission reduction potential than energy-saving scenario. We also found that gross domestic product and population are significantly correlated with the benefit-cost ratio value through the regression analysis of selected possible influencing factors. The sensitivity analysis demonstrates that benefit-cost ratio value is more sensitive to unit emission-reduction cost, unit subsidy, growth rate of gross domestic product, and discount rate among all the parameters. Compared with other provinces, the benefit-cost ratios of Beijing and Tianjin are more sensitive to changes of unit subsidy than unit emission-reduction cost. These findings may have significant implications for improving China's air pollution prevention policy. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

The results show that total cost and total benefit are 118.39 and 748.15 billion Yuan, respectively, and the estimated benefit-cost ratio is 632 in the S3 scenario. For all the scenarios, these policies are cost-effective and the eastern region has higher satisfactory values. Furthermore, the end-of-pipe scenario has greater emission reduction potential than energy-saving scenario. We also found that gross domestic product and population are significantly correlated with the benefit-cost ratio value through the regression analysis of selected possible influencing factors. The sensitivity analysis demonstrates that benefit-cost ratio value is more sensitive to unit emission-reduction cost, unit subsidy, growth rate of gross domestic product, and discount rate among all the parameters. Compared with other provinces, the benefit-cost ratios of Beijing and Tianjin are more sensitive to changes of unit subsidy than unit emission-reduction cost. These findings may have significant implications for improving China's air pollution prevention policy. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

This study is initiated to build a technological path between haze exposure and the elderly based on the positive and negative relationship between greenspace exposure and haze exposure under the background of the national strategy of healthy aging. In addition, the structured questionnaire interviews and the measured evidence-based experiments were conducted to collect data including physical environment data, crowd activity data, haze cognition data and basic population information.

However, in reality this exposure is rarely static as people move from home to work/study locations and commute during the day. Integrating mobility and time-activity data may reduce errors and biases, thereby improving estimates of health risks. Objectives: To incorporate land use regression with movement and building infiltration data to estimate time-weighted air pollution exposures stratified by age, sex, and employment status for population subgroups in Hong Kong. Methods: A large population-representative survey (N = 89,385) was used to characterize travel behavior, and derive time-activity pattern for each subject. Infiltration factors calculated from indoor/outdoor monitoring campaigns were used to estimate micro-environmental concentrations. We evaluated dynamic and static (residential location-only) exposures in a staged modeling approach to quantify effects of each component. Results: Higher levels of exposures were found for working adults and students due to increased mobility. Compared to subjects aged 65 or older, exposures to PM2.5, BC, and NO2 were 13%, 39% and 14% higher, respectively for subjects aged below 18, and 3%, 18% and 11% higher, respectively for working adults.

However, in reality this exposure is rarely static as people move from home to work/study locations and commute during the day. Integrating mobility and time-activity data may reduce errors and biases, thereby improving estimates of health risks. Objectives: To incorporate land use regression with movement and building infiltration data to estimate time-weighted air pollution exposures stratified by age, sex, and employment status for population subgroups in Hong Kong. Methods: A large population-representative survey (N = 89,385) was used to characterize travel behavior, and derive time-activity pattern for each subject. Infiltration factors calculated from indoor/outdoor monitoring campaigns were used to estimate micro-environmental concentrations. We evaluated dynamic and static (residential location-only) exposures in a staged modeling approach to quantify effects of each component. Results: Higher levels of exposures were found for working adults and students due to increased mobility. Compared to subjects aged 65 or older, exposures to PM2.5, BC, and NO2 were 13%, 39% and 14% higher, respectively for subjects aged below 18, and 3%, 18% and 11% higher, respectively for working adults. Exposures of females were approximately 4% lower than those of males. Dynamic exposures were around 20% lower than ambient exposures at residential addresses. Conclusions: The incorporation of infiltration and mobility increased heterogeneity in population exposure and allowed identification of highly exposed groups.

This confirms the assumption that the main source of NO2 in this area is motor vehicle exhaust fumes. The analysis of the results obtained in different seasons showed a significant difference (p<0.05) in NO2 concentrations under different meteorological conditions. The increase in NO2 concentrations was recorded in the winter and late autumn seasons, due to reduced solar radiation and lower temperatures. Cluster analysis results showed that sampling sites can be grouped into different classes based on NO2 main source, motor vehicles and traffic intensity.

Materials and Methods: All parents of asthmatic children referred to the Pediatric Clinic of Masih Daneshvari Hospital during one year period (250 people) completed knowledge and practice questionnaire on air pollution. Knowledge questions consisted of familiarity with pollution standard index (PSI), ways to find out about it, respiratory effects of air pollution and etc. Practice questions consisted of reducing outdoor presence and activity of children and actions taken to reduce air pollution in polluted days. Results: In general, 3.2% of parents were familiar with PSI, 12.5% were aware of ways to find out about daily air quality, 65.2% were aware of air pollution respiratory effects, 65.6% were aware of air pollution effects on asthmatic children and 4.4% were aware of ineffectiveness of surgical masks in prevention of air pollution health effects. The obtained practice score ranged from 4 to 16, and the participants' mean score was equal to 11.79. Conclusion: This study revealed that parents of asthmatic children were aware of air pollution hazards for their children and wanted to prevent them but they did not know how. Therefore, asthmatic children in Tehran are still exposed to risks of air pollution. © 2013 NRITLD, National Research Institute of Tuberculosis and Lung Disease, Iran.",Air pollution; Asthmatic children; Knowledge; Parents; Practice,air pollution; air quality; article; asthma; child; clinical practice; cross-sectional study; environmental exposure; human; Iran; knowledge; major clinical study; parental attitude; questionnaire; respiratory function; school child; scoring system; surgical mask,,Scopus,"Knowledge and practice of asthmatic children's parents about daily air quality Background: Knowledge and practice about air pollution are essential subjects in special groups such as cardio-pulmonary patients.

In this study, we aim to determine the KAP and information demand in the context of haze and its effects on health. Methods: A cross-sectional survey was conducted in Changchun, China, between October and November 2016. A purposive sample comprising four groups (college students, occupational population, traffic police, and elderly population) were investigated. Personal information and questions pertaining to KAP and information demand on haze pollution and health were collected through questionnaire. Results: The questionnaire was completed by 888 residents. The awareness rate was 57.7% and varied significantly with education, exercise, and population group (p < 0.05). Among the four groups, college students scored the lowest in attitudes and practices, whereas traffic police scored the highest. Concerning the source of information demand, the elderly and traffic police preferred traditional information access (i.e., television and newspaper), whereas college students and the occupational population preferred new social media (i.e., mobile newspaper and social media sites). Regarding the most trusted department that releases information, all residents relied on the haze information released by the environmental protection department and meteorological department.

In this study, we aim to determine the KAP and information demand in the context of haze and its effects on health. Methods: A cross-sectional survey was conducted in Changchun, China, between October and November 2016. A purposive sample comprising four groups (college students, occupational population, traffic police, and elderly population) were investigated. Personal information and questions pertaining to KAP and information demand on haze pollution and health were collected through questionnaire. Results: The questionnaire was completed by 888 residents. The awareness rate was 57.7% and varied significantly with education, exercise, and population group (p < 0.05). Among the four groups, college students scored the lowest in attitudes and practices, whereas traffic police scored the highest. Concerning the source of information demand, the elderly and traffic police preferred traditional information access (i.e., television and newspaper), whereas college students and the occupational population preferred new social media (i.e., mobile newspaper and social media sites). Regarding the most trusted department that releases information, all residents relied on the haze information released by the environmental protection department and meteorological department. The latest air quality was the most desired information of the residents. Conclusions: Changchun residents have a relatively high knowledge awareness rate. The elderly and less-educated residents are the targetable population for haze education. Education should be disseminated in such manner as to meet the needs of different people.

Methods:A questionnaire was prepared by a multidisciplinary group from published literature oil Health impact of air pollution and from local context. It was administered on line among a random sample of physicians practising in the County of the Bouches do Rhone ((Marseille, South-eastern France). The sample consisted in pediatricians (1/2), general practitioners (GP; 1/14) and pneumologists. Results: The answer rate was 79% (112/169 GP, 94/107 pediatricians, 82/91 pneumologists). Among the 288 physicians who answered the questionnaire, 44% declared they felt very concerned by air pollution, especially pediatricians. While 87% were knowledgeable about SO2 regulations, only 59% (48% among pediatricians) were knowledgeable about ozone regulations.

It also assesses the impact of frames that accentuate the costs and benefits of the nation's coal usage on individuals' support for coal-based energy development. It draws from framing theory to develop hypotheses tested in two distinct survey experiments that recruited a representative sample of residents living in the Seoul Metropolitan area. We find that frames that highlight the need for immediate policy action, by blaming China, Korea or both nations, decreases satisfaction with existing national efforts. Moreover, frames that attribute blame exclusively to China decrease satisfaction with China's efforts to combat the problem. On the domestic front, we find that Koreans' views toward increased coal use are a function of exposure to a coal-costs or coal-benefits frame; however, when the frames appear simultaneously in competition, considerations about the economic benefits overpower concerns about the negative health effects.

This study aimed to examine the awareness and perception among the policymakers regarding air pollution in Jordan. Methods: This is a cross-sectional study conducted in Jordan. The participants included in this study were governmental and non-governmental officials from different sectors. An interview and questionnaire were used to examine the extent of knowledge of these decision-makers regarding air pollution types, sources, and threats. Results: Most participants acknowledged that air pollution in Jordan was a huge problem. Most participants (90%) were familiar with the term air pollution, and regularly read about different contaminants that cause air pollution. However, most of the participants had a low level of knowledge about air contaminant types in Jordan.

The two environmental issues could be linked through people's general tastes for environmental amenities helping to determine residential location choice, implying that residents of heavily-polluted neighbourhoods may care less about envi-ronmental amenities in general, including greenspace. Alternatively, high pollution levels could force people to reduce their local outdoor activities and thereby devalue urban greenspace as local recreational resources. Finally, residents of severely-polluted areas may derive additional benefits from greenspace as trees can enhance air quality. To examine these issues, we undertook choice experiment surveys in Beijing to elicit willingness to pay (WTP) for three types of greenspace: a neighbourhood park near respondents' homes, a city park in central Beijing and a national park outside the city. We then used air pollution data to help explain the spatial heterogeneity in WTP. Neighbourhood parks provide direct air purification services for communities nearby, and our results indeed suggest that respondents exposed to higher pollution levels have higher WTP for a new neighbourhood park.

This provides a requirement for model evaluation at elevated altitudes, though observation datasets available for this purpose are limited. This is particularly true of those offering sampling over extended time periods. To address this requirement and support evaluation of regional air quality models such as the UK Met Offices Air Quality in the Unified Model (AQUM), a long-term, quality-assured dataset of the three-dimensional distribution of key pollutants was collected over the southern United Kingdom from July 2019 to April 2022. Measurements were collected using the Met Office Atmospheric Survey Aircraft (MOASA), a Cessna 421 instrumented for this project to measure gaseous nitrogen dioxide, ozone, sulfur dioxide and fine-mode (PM 2.5 ) aerosol. This paper introduces the MOASA measurement platform, flight strategies and instrumentation and is not intended to be an in-depth diagnostic analysis but rather a comprehensive technical reference for future users of these data. The MOASA air quality dataset includes 63 flight sorties (totalling over 150 h of sampling), the data from which are openly available for use. To illustrate potential uses of these upper-air observations for regional-scale model evaluation, example case studies are presented, which include analyses of the spatial scales of measured pollutant variability, a comparison of airborne to ground-based observations over Greater London and initial work to evaluate performance of the AQUM regional air quality model. These case studies show that, for observations of relative humidity, nitrogen dioxide and particle counts, natural pollutant variability is well observed by the aircraft, whereas SO 2 variability is limited by instrument precision.

Objectives: To address the gap in understanding the efficacy of policies to reduce exposure to air pollution, we sought to assess the temporal relationship between the enactment of major air pollution and climate policies in NYC and trends in air quality during the period 1998–2021. We used previously available data from citywide monitoring and new data from the Columbia Center for Children’s Environmental Health (CCCEH) longitudinal cohort studies of mothers and children living in communities in Northern Manhattan and the South Bronx. Methods: We utilized publicly available citywide air monitoring data for particulate matter (PM2.5) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) from 2009 to 2021 from the New York City Community Air Survey (NYCCAS) database and CCCEH cohort data on residential exposure to PM2.5 and NO2 and personal exposure to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) during pregnancies occurring from 1998–2016 and 1998–2021, respectively. We compared annual and overall reductions in PM2.5 and NO2 citywide and reductions in PAH concentrations in the cohort studies. Results: As previously reported, annual average concentrations of pollutants in NYC dropped significantly over time. Between 1998 and 2021, PM2.5 and NO2 concentrations were reduced citywide by 37 and 31%, respectively. In our CCCEH cohorts, between 1998 and 2016, the annual average PM2.5 and NO2 concentrations also decreased significantly by 51 and 48%, respectively. Between 1998 and 2020, PAH concentrations decreased significantly by 66%. Discussion/conclusion: While it is not possible to link improved air quality to a single policy, our analysis provides evidence of a cumulative beneficial effect of clean air and climate policies enacted between 1998 and 2021 both city-wide and in our cohorts residing in communities that have been disproportionately affected by air pollution. There are important implications for health benefits, particularly for children, who are known to be especially vulnerable to these exposures.

Less well understood is how the distribution of health benefits from the MP/RB and traditional strategies affect the existing inequalities in air-pollution-related risks in Detroit. In this article, we identify Detroit populations that may be both most susceptible to air pollution health impacts (based on local-scale baseline health data) and most vulnerable to air pollution (based on fine-scale PM2.5 air quality modeling and socioeconomic characteristics). Using these susceptible/vulnerable subpopulation profiles, we assess the relative impacts of each control strategy on risk inequality, applying the Atkinson Index (AI) to quantify health risk inequality at baseline and with either risk management approach. We find that the MP/RB approach delivers greater air quality improvements among these subpopulations while also generating substantial benefits among lower-risk populations.

This interaction can result in negative outcomes like air pollution and its health implications. There is a significant data deficit in air quality monitoring across many developing nations, which prevents effective policies and measures from being taken to promote the accomplishment of sustainable devel-opment. Around the world, lichens have been used to track environmental changes due to their sensitivity to changes and concentration of atmospheric pollutants. This study investigated the relationships between lichen and air quality across some Nigerian cities. Lichen surveys were conducted in four cities. At various periods during the day, NO2, SO2, PM2.5, and PM10 levels were measured. Association rule mining was carried out to investigate the relationship between lichen found and air quality categories. Results showed that the most prevalent lichen Genera are Pyxine in Abuja and Kano, Diorygma in Lagos, and Dirinaria in Port Harcourt. Out of the 40 rules found from the rule mining, 17 are important (lift values >= 1.1), capturing six of the fourteen lichen genera identified in the field. The findings indicated that there are important relationships be-tween lichens and air quality indices, suggesting that some lichen species in Nigeria may serve as indicators of long-term air quality. To develop a network of urban environmental quality bio-indicators across Nigerian cities, surveying and transplanting are advised. The use of lichen for air quality monitoring can provide information for sustainable management of air quality and environmental quality in Nigeria.",Lichens; Association rule; Air quality; Air pollution; Urban environment; Urban environmental quality,,NITROGEN DEPOSITION; POLLUTION; DIVERSITY; BIOINDICATORS; COMMUNITIES; INDICATORS; FORESTS; CLIMATE; IMPACT; LOADS,WOS,"Mining association rules between lichens and air quality to support urban air quality monitoring in Nigeria Urban environments represent the most intense human-environment interaction.

There is a significant data deficit in air quality monitoring across many developing nations, which prevents effective policies and measures from being taken to promote the accomplishment of sustainable devel-opment. Around the world, lichens have been used to track environmental changes due to their sensitivity to changes and concentration of atmospheric pollutants. This study investigated the relationships between lichen and air quality across some Nigerian cities. Lichen surveys were conducted in four cities. At various periods during the day, NO2, SO2, PM2.5, and PM10 levels were measured. Association rule mining was carried out to investigate the relationship between lichen found and air quality categories. Results showed that the most prevalent lichen Genera are Pyxine in Abuja and Kano, Diorygma in Lagos, and Dirinaria in Port Harcourt. Out of the 40 rules found from the rule mining, 17 are important (lift values >= 1.1), capturing six of the fourteen lichen genera identified in the field. The findings indicated that there are important relationships be-tween lichens and air quality indices, suggesting that some lichen species in Nigeria may serve as indicators of long-term air quality. To develop a network of urban environmental quality bio-indicators across Nigerian cities, surveying and transplanting are advised. The use of lichen for air quality monitoring can provide information for sustainable management of air quality and environmental quality in Nigeria.

This study was undertaken to investigate the link between air pollution and health impacts for Mumbai, and estimate the monetary burden of these impacts. Study design: Cross-sectional data were subjected to logistic regression to analyse the link between air pollution and health impacts, and the cost of illness approach was used to measure the monetary burden of these impacts. Methods: Data collected by the Environmental Pollution Research Centre at King Edward Memorial Hospital in Mumbai were analysed using logistic regression to investigate the link between air pollution and morbidity impacts. The monetary burden of morbidity was estimated through the cost of illness approach. For this purpose, information on treatment costs and foregone earnings due to illness was obtained through the household survey and interviews with medical practitioners. Results: Particulate matter (PM(10)) and nitrogen dioxide (NO(2)) emerged as the critical pollutants for a range of health impacts, including symptoms such as cough, breathlessness, wheezing and cold, and illnesses such as allergic rhinitis and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). This study developed the concentration-response coefficients for these health impacts. The total monetary burden of these impacts, including personal burden, government expenditure and societal cost, is estimated at 4522.96 million Indian Rupees (INR) or US$ 113.08 million for a 50-mu g/m(3) increase in PM(10), and INR 8723.59 million or US$ 218.10 million for a similar increase in NO(2). Conclusions: The estimated monetary burden of health impacts associated with air pollution in Mumbai mainly comprises out-of-pocket expenses of city residents. These expenses form a sizable proportion of the annual income of individuals, particularly those belonging to poor households. These findings have implications for public health policy, particularly accessibility and affordability of health care for poor households in Mumbai.

Temperature was found to be the only environmental parameter that was significantly associated with lower IAQ perception reported by the teachers, highlighting that typical pollutants such as CO2 (which can be identified as stuffy air) did not contribute to the teachers’ perceptions. © 2024 by the authors. indoor air quality; low-cost sensors; perception; schools; ventilation Air quality; Direct air capture; Environmental monitoring; Teaching; Air pollutants; Comfort parameter; Indoor air quality; Indoor air quality monitoring; Low-cost sensors; Monitoring surveys; Pollutant parameters; School; Teachers'; Teachers' perceptions; air quality; indoor air; parameterization; perception; survey method; ventilation; Indoor air pollution","```json

Few studies have examined neighborhood perceptions as important and modifiable non-chemical stressors of the built environment that may exacerbate effects of air pollution on cardiopulmonary health outcomes, particularly among general population based cohorts. This study examined associations between low-level chronic exposure to fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and cardiopulmonary health, and the potential mediating or modifying effects of adverse neighborhood perceptions. Using data from the Survey of the Health of Wisconsin (SHOW), 2230 non-asthmatic adults age 21-74 were included in the analyses. The overall goals of this study were to assess if individuals who experience stress from neighborhood environments in which they live were more sensitive to low levels of fine particular matter (PM2.5 g/m(3)). Demographic predictors of air pollution exposure included younger age, non-White race, lower education and middle class income. After adjustments, objective lung function measures (FEV1 and FEV1 to FVC ratio) were the only cardiopulmonary health indicators significantly associated with chronic three-year annual averages of PM2.5. Among all non-asthmatics, a ten unit increase in estimated three year annual average PM2.5 exposure was significantly associated with lower forced expiratory volume (L) in one second FEV1 ( = -0.40 g/L; 95% CI -0.45, -0.06). Among all individuals, adverse perceptions of the neighborhood built environment did not appear to statistically moderate or mediate associations. However, stratified analysis did reveal significant associations between PM2.5 and lung function (FEV1) only among individuals with negative perceptions and increased reports of neighborhood stressors. These findings included individuals who felt their neighborhoods were poorly maintained ( = -0.82; 95% CI -1.35, -0.28), experienced stress from crime ( = -0.45; 95% CI -0.94, 0.04) or reported neighborhood is not well maintained ( = -1.13, CI -2.04, -0.24).

Indoor air questionnaires are useful for collecting information about the occupants' experiences and perceptions of the indoor air and for evaluating the results of the measures taken. A common way to implement health questionnaires is to ask the respondents to describe symptoms at certain time points, such as weeks or months. The aim of our study was to develop a short and easy online questionnaire to assess symptoms and perceived IAQ. We also aimed to test the usability of the questionnaire in school buildings and assess the differences between the online measurement data (CO2, T, and RH) and the IAQ complaints and symptoms reported by the pupils. A total of 105 teachers and 1268 pupils in 36 classrooms at six schools answered the questionnaires over a two-week period. The participants completed the questionnaire always after the lesson in the studied classroom. We received 719 answers from the teachers and 6322 answers from the pupils. The results demonstrated that the teachers reported more IAQ problems and symptoms than the pupils did. Differences between classrooms were observed in both the IAQ problem and reference schools. The most common significant differences (p-value > 0.05) between the classrooms were among humidity, too cold air, and stuffy air, and among symptoms, dry/sore throat, tiredness, headache, and skin symptoms. Maximum values of CO2 measurements and the highest prevalence of stuffy air were relatively consistent. The testing process demonstrated that such a questionnaire was suitable for adults and children aged at least 12 years. The results of our study suggest that a quick and easy online questionnaire that is completed within a short period may be useful for gathering valuable knowledge about perceived IAQ.

Media coverage of air pollution issues plays an important role in influencing public opinion and increasing citizen demand for action on clean air policy. Hence, this study was designed to assess news coverage of air pollution in India and its implications for policy advancement. Methods Articles published online between 1 January 2014 and 31 October 2015 that discussed air pollution in India were systematically content analysed. From 6435 articles in the national media and 271 articles in the international media, a random selection of 500 articles (400 from national and 100 from international media) were analysed and coded by two independent coders, after high inter-rater reliability (kappa statistic above 0.8) was established. Results There was an increase in the number of news stories on air pollution in India in the national media over the study period; 317 (63%) stories described the risk to health from air pollution as moderately to extremely severe, and 393 (79%) stories described the situation as needing urgent action. Limited information was provided on the kinds of illnesses that can result from exposure. Less than 30% of stories in either media specifically mentioned the common illnesses resulting from air pollution. Very few articles in either media mentioned the population groups most at risk from air pollution, such as children or older people. Vehicles were presented most often as the cause of air pollution in India (in over 50% of articles in both national and international media). Some of the most important sources of air pollution were mentioned less often: 6% of national and 18% of international media articles mentioned unclean sources of household energy; 3% of national and 9% of international media articles mentioned agricultural field burning. Finally, the majority of articles (405; 81%) did not mention any specific institution or organization - such as the government or industry groups - as the primary responsible stakeholder, thus leaving ambiguous the organizations whose leadership was necessary to mitigate air pollution. Conclusion Gaps exist in the current media discourse on air pollution, suggesting the need for strengthening engagement with the media as a means of creating citizen engagement and enabling policy action. Through greater elaboration of the health burdens and evidence-based policy actions, the media can play a critical role in galvanizing India's action on air quality.

We use data from a Norwegian CVM survey focusing on WTP for a 50% reduction in air pollution from car traffic to test for the existence of ordering effects and to apply a test for internal consistency. We found considerable and significant ordering effects in our data, but were not able to reject the hypothesis of internal consistency. Based on our survey, we argue that ordering effects may be a result of rational choice. These effects are problematic if a sequential valuation procedure is applied to a simultaneous problem, and/or the respondents are given imperfect information about the decision problem. air pollution; contingent valuation; health damage; ordering effects Acid rain; Environmental impact; Exhaust gases; Health hazards; Health risks; Particulate emissions; Pulmonary diseases; Chronic bronchitis; Contingent valuation method (CVM); Air pollution control","```json

Methods: We analyzed data from the Porter Novelli Public Services YouthStyles survey, a nationally representative survey of U.S. adolescents aged 12-17 years. In survey years 2015-2018, a total of 3,547 adolescents self-reported awareness, perceptions, and behaviors related to air pollution. We calculated weighted percentages of respondents reporting each aspect of air quality awareness, perception, and behaviors overall and by categories of age, gender, parental education, metropolitan status, region, and survey year. Results: Overall, an estimated 81% of U.S. adolescents thought outdoor air pollution could impact health, 52% thought there were things they could do to limit their or their family's exposure, 19% were aware of air quality alerts, 46% of those who thought or were informed air quality was bad did something differently, and 19% always or usually avoided busy roads to reduce air pollution exposure; differences were reported by some demographic variables. Conclusions: Among U.S. adolescents, awareness that air pollution could impact health was relatively high. However, gaps were found in the awareness of the potential impacts and other aspects of awareness and perceptions related to air pollution and the engagement in behaviors to reduce exposure, some of which varied by demographic characteristics.

The low-idle emissions data from these surveys show that 10 percent of the fleet are responsible for about 60 percent of the exhaust hydrocarbons and also that 10 percent of the fleet (not necessarily the same vehicles) are responsible for about 60 percent of the carbon monoxide emissions. We also show that high emitters appear among all model years, and not just among old vehicles, as previously assumed. Old vehicles, on average, have higher idle emissions than new vehicles, but they contribute relatively little to the total idle emissions because there are so few on the road. We compare roadside survey results at I/M and non-I/M locations in California, and observe identical tampering and overall failure rates at the two types of locations. We also show that motorists are taking steps to ''pass the test,'' and that the high-emitting vehicles' idle-emissions performance and tampering rates in the roadside surveys are unaffected by the Smog Check test. These results imply that success in California's Smog Check program in reducing emissions will require consideration of human behavior and the attendant negative incentives inherent in the program as historically conceived.

Many studies generated PM2.5 concentration networks with resolutions of 3 km or 10 km. However, the relatively coarse resolution of the satellite AOD products make it difficult to determine the fine-scale characteristics of PM2.5 distributions that are important for urban air quality analysis. In addition, the composition and chemical properties of PM2.5 are relatively complex and might be affected by many factors, such as meteorological and land cover type factors. In this paper, an AOD product with a 1 km spatial resolution derived from the Multi-Angle Implementation of Atmospheric Correction (MAIAC) algorithm, the PM2.5 measurements from ground sites and the meteorological data as the auxiliary variable, are integrated into the Modified Support Vector Regression (MSVR) model that proposed in this paper to estimate the PM2.5 concentrations and analyze the spatiotemporal pattern of PM2.5. Considering the relatively small dataset and the somewhat complex relationship between the variables, we propose a Modified Support Vector Regression (MSVR) model that based on SVR to fit and estimate the PM2.5 concentrations in Hubei province of China. In this paper, we obtained Cross Correlation Coefficient (R-2) of 0.74 for the regression of independent and dependent variables, and the conventional SVR model obtained R-2 of 0.60 as comparison. We think our MSVR model obtained relatively good performance in spite of many complex factors that might impact the accuracy. We then utilized the optimal MSVR model to perform the PM2.5 estimating, analyze their spatiotemporal patterns, and try to explain the possible reasons for these patterns.

Many studies generated PM2.5 concentration networks with resolutions of 3 km or 10 km. However, the relatively coarse resolution of the satellite AOD products make it difficult to determine the fine-scale characteristics of PM2.5 distributions that are important for urban air quality analysis. In addition, the composition and chemical properties of PM2.5 are relatively complex and might be affected by many factors, such as meteorological and land cover type factors. In this paper, an AOD product with a 1 km spatial resolution derived from the Multi-Angle Implementation of Atmospheric Correction (MAIAC) algorithm, the PM2.5 measurements from ground sites and the meteorological data as the auxiliary variable, are integrated into the Modified Support Vector Regression (MSVR) model that proposed in this paper to estimate the PM2.5 concentrations and analyze the spatiotemporal pattern of PM2.5. Considering the relatively small dataset and the somewhat complex relationship between the variables, we propose a Modified Support Vector Regression (MSVR) model that based on SVR to fit and estimate the PM2.5 concentrations in Hubei province of China. In this paper, we obtained Cross Correlation Coefficient (R-2) of 0.74 for the regression of independent and dependent variables, and the conventional SVR model obtained R-2 of 0.60 as comparison. We think our MSVR model obtained relatively good performance in spite of many complex factors that might impact the accuracy. We then utilized the optimal MSVR model to perform the PM2.5 estimating, analyze their spatiotemporal patterns, and try to explain the possible reasons for these patterns. The results showed that the PM2.5 estimations retrieved from 1 km MAIAC AOD could reflect more detailed spatial distribution characteristics of PM2.5 and have higher accuracy than that from 3 km MODIS AOD. Therefore, the proposed MSVR model can be a better method for PM2.5 estimating, especially when the dataset is relatively small.

Local and national public health authorities and the French Institute for Public Health Surveillance (InVS) were informed. Some public health professionals considered that exposure to those pesticide levels was unlikely to pose a significant risk. Nevertheless, in view of the political risk and in application of the precautionary principle, the public authorities decided to close the whole school. Before the start of decontamination, they requested a human health risk assessment by InVS and AFSSET. In response, the two agencies implemented a risk assessment and management process involving representatives of the people who might have been exposed (parents of pupils, teachers, non-teaching staff).

However, few studies have focused on the effect of street regeneration on air quality perception and user satisfaction. The influence of the physical environment on street vitality may vary, depending on area context and regional factors. A comprehensive understanding of effective interventions could increase pedestrians' satisfaction with their walking environment. This study examines the effect of pedestrianization on individuals' air quality perception and satisfaction, based on three regenerated streets in Seoul, Korea. We analyzed data from 672 questionnaires administered after the pedestrianization project. We used a subset of variables in a binary logistic regression model to understand general determinants of user satisfaction toward their walking environment. Our case study contributes to the verification of pedestrianization effects on air quality perceptions. Results show that overall satisfaction could be acquired through positive perceptions of air quality, as achieved through pedestrianization of streets.

Nevertheless, health promotion emphasizing the impact of air pollution is not popular, even among health professionals. Therefore, this study aimed to explore the perceptions of paediatricians regarding its impact on children’s health in Indonesia. Materials and Methods: A cross-sectional design using an online questionnaire was employed in this study. It was composed of 30 items and divided into 4 sections, i.e. section 1 explored the demographic variables, section 2 measured the respondent’s information-seeking behavior on the issue of air pollution, section 3 measured the perception of issues related to air pollution and its impact on children’s health, and section 4 explored the respondent’s experience in practicing environmental health education with respect to their patients. Only completed surveys were analysed. Results: Of the 171 pediatricians who were accessed for the survey, 120 (70.2%) completed it. The majority of respondents (69%) resided in Java island and worked in urban areas (84%). About 41.7% of the respondents had little to no information on the impact of air pollution on children’s health. More than 80% of the respondents received information from scientific articles, followed by seminars (61.5%), the internet (53.8%), colleagues (30.7%), and workshops/training (17.3%). Nearly one-third of the respondents considered air quality as poor in their working environment. Almost all agreed that air pollution can affect children’s health and increase the risk of respiratory allergies and even the risk of skin allergies for children under two years of age. In daily practice, most respondents (53.3%) admitted that they never or rarely treated patients with diseases related to air pollution. About one-third of the respondents (36.7%) had never or rarely asked their patients about their living environment.

The comparison with the results of a previous study obtained using air pollution station data confirmed the dependence of air quality perception on participants' characteristics and particularly on their health status. Ordinal logistic regression models showed that for pedestrians who were neither smokers nor experiencing health symptoms and were exposed to outdoor conditions for more than 30min, a PM10 concentration around 64g m( -3) could be a threshold, to perceive dusty air quality conditions.

Objective environmental governance performance needs to be perceived by the public to more truly affect the public's evaluation of the government's environmental governance. This paper focuses on the public's subjective perception of air pollution and evaluation of the local government's environmental governance. Based on the Chinese General Social Survey data, the matched economic indicators, and air pollution data, we conduct a diachronic study on the public's evaluation of local governments' environmental protection work, and we analyze the relationship between the subjective perception of air pollution, the objective air pollution data, and the evaluation of local governments' environmental protection work.

Objective environmental governance performance needs to be perceived by the public to more truly affect the public's evaluation of the government's environmental governance. This paper focuses on the public's subjective perception of air pollution and evaluation of the local government's environmental governance. Based on the Chinese General Social Survey data, the matched economic indicators, and air pollution data, we conduct a diachronic study on the public's evaluation of local governments' environmental protection work, and we analyze the relationship between the subjective perception of air pollution, the objective air pollution data, and the evaluation of local governments' environmental protection work. The results showed the following: (1) People's evaluation of local governments' environmental protection work significantly improved from 2013 to 2021.

We aim to clarify the extent to which perceived risks from road-traffic and wood-smoke can be explained by the individual psychological, social status-related and socio-institutional factors in the case of two Northern European countries, Finland and Estonia. This approach elucidates which of the closely intertwined factors shape the perception of risks from air pollution in different socio-institutional contexts and for different air pollution sources. The study uses data from cross-sectional population surveys conducted among 1112 Finnish and 1000 Estonian residents about environmental health risk perception and coping. Binary logistic regression analysis demonstrated that in both countries' cases, the perceived personal and general risk from traffic exhaust and wood-smoke can be explained by the perception of exposure to pollution and, also, by the level of knowledge of, the worry about and the possible symptoms from environmental health factors. The perceived vulnerability due to poor health further sensitises individuals towards risks from air pollution. Higher trust towards state institutions in guaranteeing a healthy living environment and greater perceived openness about the risks may attenuate the feelings of vulnerability to air pollution risks in Finland compared to Estonia.

Several authors have considered these relationships within a phenomenological framework. As a preliminary consideration, we have attempted in this study to isolate geographical sectors with variable exposure to air pollution. We have taken readings from seven stations for the period of January 1977 to December 1980; with the help of the difference of means test, we have singled out the significant variants. Based on these findings, we have used the gravity model to determine the strong, average, and weak sectors of exposure to total dust concentration in the air. During the summer of 1980, we submitted a stratified sampling embracing 229 persons, compiled by a telephone questionnaire, with a view to assessing to what extent the population was concerned by pollution in the surrounding air, evaluating public opinion on alternate solutions to resolve this problem, and generally investigating whether the public conscience was sufficiently crystallized to embark upon local environmental protection measures. The Quebec mining town of Thetford Mines, an important centre for asbestos extraction, was used for this investigation. The findings indicate that the population has a generally well-perceived notion of pollution even if water pollution was stressed more than air pollution. However, the perception of air pollution is dependent on distance from the mine and consequently, on exposure sectors to total dust concentration in the air. We assembled, into three groups, some 14 alternate means to attack pollution. The most exposed sector favoured indirect actions, while in other sectors direct measures were accented. Socioeconomic standing and especially education level help explain perceived differences between types of pollution, whereas sex and age are statistically significant for the choice of alternate means. Length of residence has very little influence. Generally, it does not seem that the respondents' opinion are clearly and coherently crystallized. This is understandable if we accept that the respondents appear to dissociate water from air pollution.

People's perceptions and concerns about air pollution are important as they may predict protective behaviour or support for climate change mitigation policies. Methods: This repeat cross-sectional study uses survey data collected from participants in Sydney, Australia in September-November 2019 (n = 1,647) and October-December 2020 (n = 1,458), before and after the devastating 2019/2020 bushfires and first COVID-19 lockdown restrictions in Sydney in 2020. Participants' perceptions of air quality and concerns for health in relation to air quality were modeled against estimates of annual average NO2 and PM2.5 concentrations in their neighbourhood. Results: Participants in suburbs with higher estimated air pollution concentrations generally perceived poorer air quality and were more concerned for health in relation to air quality. A 5 mu g/m(3) increase in NO2 was associated with perceived poorer air quality (OR 1.32, 95%CI 1.18-1.47). A 1 mu g/m(3) increase in estimated PM2.5 was associated with perceived poorer air quality (OR 1.37, 95%CI 1.24-1.52) and greater concern for health (OR 1.18, 95%CI 1.05-1.32).

The purpose of this study was to evaluate possible associations between ventilation system type and occupant perception of indoor air quality. Staff (n = 403) from 12 schools completed a self-administered questionnaire. Carbon dioxide (CO2) levels, air exchange rates, and particle counts were also measured for each school. Schools with unit ventilator (UV) systems had the lowest mean CO2 level at 637 ppm, followed by the variable air volume (VAV) systems with 664 ppm, and constant volume (CV) systems with a mean of 703 ppm. Schools with UV systems had the lowest mean air exchange rate at 2.67 air changes per hour (ACH), followed by the VAV system type at 2.80 ACH and the CV system type at 4.61 ACH. Indoor versus outdoor particle ratios were calculated for each ventilation system type.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate possible associations between ventilation system type and occupant perception of indoor air quality. Staff (n = 403) from 12 schools completed a self-administered questionnaire. Carbon dioxide (CO2) levels, air exchange rates, and particle counts were also measured for each school. Schools with unit ventilator (UV) systems had the lowest mean CO2 level at 637 ppm, followed by the variable air volume (VAV) systems with 664 ppm, and constant volume (CV) systems with a mean of 703 ppm. Schools with UV systems had the lowest mean air exchange rate at 2.67 air changes per hour (ACH), followed by the VAV system type at 2.80 ACH and the CV system type at 4.61 ACH. Indoor versus outdoor particle ratios were calculated for each ventilation system type. Particles with aerodynamic diameters ranging from 0.1-1.0 μm had a geometric mean ratio ranging from 0.38 to 0.68; particles with aerodynamic diameters ranging from 1-3 μm had ratios ranging from 1.39 to 5.47, and particles with aerodynamic diameters greater than 3 μm had ratios ranging from 3.20 to 14.76.

In Chile, many cities exceed theWorld Health Organization's norms for ambient concentration of particulatematter. In this paper, we analyze the factors explaining individuals' perceptions on fuelwood as themain cause of air pollution in urban areas and their willingness to ban this fuel to counteract its negative effects. We also explore variation across these perceptions and preferences based on individuals' degree of familiarity with air pollution and the extent towhich they are affected by the regulation in place. Using data fromthe fourth environmental survey in Chile, we estimate an ordered bivariate probitmodel to account for a potential link between these perceptions and preferences. Results reveal a disconnect between perception of the problem and preferences for regulation to the extent that individuals are more likely to be affected by the regulation (i.e., fuelwood users and regulated cities). We also find that lower-income individuals are less willing to accept a fuelwood ban, and that the level of air pollutionmatters in shaping individuals' perceptions on the causes of poor air quality and preferences for regulations, although this depends on the measures used. Finally, we find evidence that pro-environmental behavior in other domains negatively affects the perception prohibiting fuelwood use. Thus, froma policy design perspective, it is essential to consider individuals' perceptions on environmental issues and preferences for regulations, because they might be linked with feasibility of implementation and compliance.

Public health and civil protection agencies have offered a range of ad -vice, information, and mitigation strategies for living with vog. In this mixed-methods social study, we investigate the translation of official advice into practice in Island of Hawai'i communi-ties and assess how risk communication could be improved by considering public input, prefer-ences, and community relevance. Given the paucity of information on the long-term effects of chronic vog exposure, assessing the effectiveness of public health and risk communication is vi-tal.

We also investigated local knowledge and self-developed interven-tions and documented the perceived risks of vog exposure, including symptoms that people at-tribute to vog. Most participants (83%) perceived that vog caused health symptoms such as exacerbation of asthma, itchy eyes, and blocked nose and 62% thought it was harmful to their long-term health.

The hypothesis that lung inflammation is responsible for these effects has been tested in panel and controlled exposure studies in asthmatic adults, with inconsistent results. Objectives: We investigated whether personal exposure to PM10 and PM2.5 were related to changes in the clinical course of asthma and to lung inflammatory responses in adult asthmatics. Methods: A cohort of 32 asthmatic patients was followed for 2 years. Asthma control test (ACT) and St George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) scores, forced expired volume in the first second (FEV1), exhaled nitric oxide (Fe-NO), and pH of exhaled breath condensate (EBC) were determined on 6 occasions during different seasons. Personal exposure to PM was measured for 24 hours prior to clinical assessments. Results: A 10 mu g/m(3) increase in PM10 personal exposure was associated with an increase in SGRQ scores (regression coefficient beta=0.22; 95% confidence interval [CI], -0.005 to 4.451; P=.055) and with a decrease in ACT scores (beta=-0.022; 95% CI, -0.045 to 0.001; P=.060), whereas no associations were found between PM10 and FEV1, Fe-NO, or EBC pH.

The hypothesis that lung inflammation is responsible for these effects has been tested in panel and controlled exposure studies in asthmatic adults, with inconsistent results. Objectives: We investigated whether personal exposure to PM10 and PM2.5 were related to changes in the clinical course of asthma and to lung inflammatory responses in adult asthmatics. Methods: A cohort of 32 asthmatic patients was followed for 2 years. Asthma control test (ACT) and St George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) scores, forced expired volume in the first second (FEV1), exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO), and pH of exhaled breath condensate (EBC) were determined on 6 occasions during different seasons. Personal exposure to PM was measured for 24 hours prior to clinical assessments. Results: A 10 μg/m3 increase in PM10 personal exposure was associated with an increase in SGRQ scores (regression coefficient ß=0.22; 95% confidence interval [CI], -0.005 to 4.451; P=.055) and with a decrease in ACT scores (ß=-0.022; 95% CI, -0.045 to 0.001; P=.060), whereas no associations were found between PM10 and FEV1, FeNO, or EBC pH. A positive association was detected between FeNO and outdoor O3 (P=.042) and SO2 (P=.042) concentrations in the subgroup of nonsmoking asthmatics. Conclusions: We concluded that increments in personal exposure to PM10 are associated with a decrease in asthma control and healthrelated quality of life.

Methods: Between March and May 2009, an SHS exposure survey was conducted. PM2.5 levels and air nicotine concentrations were measured in hospitals (n=5), government buildings (4), restaurants (10) and entertainment venues (10) in Seoul, Republic of Korea, using a common protocol. Field researchers completed an observational questionnaire to document evidence of active smoking (the smell of cigarette smoke, presence of cigarette butts and witnessing people smoking) and administered a questionnaire regarding building characteristics and smoking policy. Results: Indoor PM2.5 levels and air nicotine concentrations were relatively higher in monitoring sites where smoking is not prohibited by law. Entertainment venues had the highest values of PM2.5(mu g/m(3)) and air nicotine concentration(mu g/m(3)), which were 7.6 and 67.9 fold higher than those of hospitals, respectively, where the values were the lowest.

PSPSs have been increasingly deployed in the Western U.S. during extreme wildfire conditions to reduce ignition risk from power equipment by de-energizing sections of the electrical grid, potentially leaving impacted areas without electricity for multiple days. We surveyed Oregon residents (n = 1,308), a state where few PSPSs have been deployed, and found that a majority of respondents supported PSPSs, and that poorer air quality during wildfires, recorded from monitoring stations proximal to respondents, was related to increased support for PSPSs. We also found that females and those with liberal political orientations were more supportive of PSPSs. This research has implications for utilities, emergency managers, and policymakers as they consider deployment of PSPSs to mitigate wildfire.

Large evidence indicates that indoor air pollution in India is responsible for a high degree of morbidity and mortality. There are virtually no epidemiological studies from India assessing the level of awareness of indoor air pollution leading to respiratory diseases in population. This study was carried out to assess the level of awareness about indoor air pollution in urban Indian population and to identify factors that influence this awareness. Methods: A total of 754 subjects including 489 asthmatic patients and 265 control subjects (aged >18 years) were recruited in this study. Responses to a questionnaire about indoor air pollution awareness in the form of list of factors responsible for it were collected from all subjects. Knowledge of subjects was assessed in terms of the total score obtained by them. A score of 25 out of 100 was considered as minimum for adequate awareness. The influence of age, gender, educational status and socioeconomic status was also analyzed. Results: 98.8% of the total subjects were not able to score more than 25 marks. Out of 754 subjects 485 patients and 260 controls could not pass the test. There was no difference between males and females regarding the knowledge about indoor air pollution (2.7% pass vs 1.8% pass, not significance [nS]). Highly educated subjects were associated with more awareness compared to less educated subjects but the difference was statistically not significant. (2.9% pass vs. 1.5% pass, nS). Socioeconomic status had no influence. Age-wise distribution showed that young adults and adults had more knowledge compared to older people but this difference was also not statistically significant (2.8% pass vs. 0.95% pass, nS). To our surprise, awareness about pollution caused by chullah (biomass stove) and kerosene stove was very poor though these are the two most important sources responsible for maximum damage to health.

This study examines for the first time trends in the association between HAP from cooking fuel and under-five mortality and measures the potential impact of interventions to reduce HAP using Nepal Demographic and Health Survey datasets (2001-2011). Methods A total of 17,780 living children across four age-groups (neonatal 0-28 days, post-neonatal 1-11 months, child 12-59 months and under-five 0-59 months) were included and multi-level logistic regression models were used for analyses. Population attributable fractions of key risk factors and potential impact fractions assessing the impact of previous interventions to reduce exposure prevalence were also calculated. Results Use of cooking fuel was associated with total under-five mortality (OR 2.19, 95% CI 1.37-3.51, P = 0.001) in Nepal, with stronger associations evident for sub-group analyses of neonatal mortality (OR 2.67, 95% CI 1.47-4.82, P = 0.001). Higher association was found in rural areas and for households without a separate kitchen using polluting fuel for cooking, and in women who had never breastfed for all age-groups of children. PIF estimates, assuming a 63% of reduction of HAP based on previously published interventions in Nepal, suggested that a burden of 40% of neonatal and 33% of under-five mortality cases associated with an indoor kitchen using polluting fuel could be avoidable.

Aspects of the BI influencing parents with young children that earned undergraduate group and post-graduate group were analysed using Smart Partial Least Squares 2.0 software. Results Our results revealed there were substantial differences in the AT of parents with young children that earned undergraduate and post-graduate degrees with respect to exposure to air with PM2.5 pollution. Conclusions In this study we assessed the factors that influence the air pollution prevention and avoidance behaviors of parents of the undergraduate and post-graduate groups that were exposed to air polluted with PM2.5. Our results show the AT, SN, PBC, and BI used in the air pollution protection model for the parents of both groups are connected by separate pathways. The undergraduate group has a higher PBC compared to the post-graduate group because the SN associated with their social ecosystems contribute to their BI.

Methods The TPB model was used to predict the BI of parents with young children with different levels of education that live in Hong Kong using the results collected from 410 online questionnaires. Aspects of the BI influencing parents with young children that earned undergraduate group and post-graduate group were analysed using Smart Partial Least Squares 2.0 software. Results Our results revealed there were substantial differences in the AT of parents with young children that earned undergraduate and post-graduate degrees with respect to exposure to air with PM2.5 pollution. Conclusions In this study we assessed the factors that influence the air pollution prevention and avoidance behaviors of parents of the undergraduate and post-graduate groups that were exposed to air polluted with PM2.5. Our results show the AT, SN, PBC, and BI used in the air pollution protection model for the parents of both groups are connected by separate pathways. The undergraduate group has a higher PBC compared to the post-graduate group because the SN associated with their social ecosystems contribute to their BI. Using path analysis, we revealed that the undergraduate and post-graduate groups had different BI paths. The BI path of the undergraduate group is purer and simpler when compared with the path of the post-graduate group.

Rapid development in cities like Yangon and Mandalay might exacerbate pollution while increasing time spent indoors. This study aims to assess the knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAP) related to Indoor Air Pollution (IAP) among residents of Yangon and Mandalay. Methods: A preliminary cross-sectional survey was conducted with 150 participants, with 58% from Yangon and 42% from Mandalay. Sociodemographic details, knowledge, attitudes, and self -reported practices related to Indoor Air Pollution (IAP) were assessed using an online self -reported questionnaire. Knowledge was scored based on correctly identifying sources, possible health effects, and mitigation approaches. Attitude questions utilized 4 -point Likert scales, while practice questions employed a binary response (yes/no). Frequencies were used as summaries for sociodemographic, knowledge, attitudes, and practices. Results: Most participants correctly identified cooking fuel (80%), poor ventilation (69.33%), and mold (62%) as sources of pollution. Furthermore, 82.67% of respondents identified eye, nose, and throat irritation as health effects of prolonged exposure to indoor air pollution.

We examined associations between prenatal exposure to traffic-related air pollution and child behavioral development milestone delays, using data from a nationwide population-based longitudinal survey in Japan, where the participants were recruited in 2001 and followed. Methods: Particulate matter, nitrogen dioxide, and sulfur dioxide concentrations during the 9 months before birth were obtained at the municipality level and assigned to the participants who were born in the corresponding municipality.

Aims: Examine associations of gestational and childhood exposure to traffic-related pollution with executive function and behavior problems in children. Methods: We studied associations of pre- and postnatal pollution exposures with neurobehavioral outcomes in 1212 children in the Project Viva pre-birth cohort followed to mid-childhood (median age 7.7 years). Parents and classroom teachers completed the Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function (BRIEF) and the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ). Using validated spatiotemporal models, we estimated exposure to black carbon (BC) and fine particulate matter (PM2.5) in the third trimester of pregnancy, from birth to 3 years, from birth to 6 years, and in the year before behavioral ratings. We also measured residential distance to major roadways and near-residence traffic density at birth and-in mid-childhood. We estimated associations of BC, PM2.5, and other traffic exposure measures with BRIEF and SDQ scores, adjusted for potential confounders. Results: Higher childhood BC exposure was associated with higher teacher-rated BRIEF Behavioral Regulation Index (BRI) scores, indicating greater problems: 1.0 points (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.0, 2.1) per interquartile range (IQR) increase in birth-age 6 BC, and 1.7 points (95% CI: 0.6, 2.8) for BC in the year prior to behavioral ratings. Mid childhood residential traffic density was also associated with BRI score (0.6, 95% CI: 0.1,1.1). Birth-age 3 BC was not associated with BRIEF or SDQscores. Third trimester BC exposure was not associated with teacher-rated BRI scores ( -0.2, 95% CI: -1.1, 0.8), and predicted lower scores (fewer problems) on the BRIEF Metacognition Index (-1.2, 95% CI: -2.2, -0.2) and SDQ total difficulties (-0.9, 95% CI: -1.4, -0.4).

We thus examined associations between prenatal exposure to outdoor air pollution and child behavioral problems at school age, using data from a nationwide population-based longitudinal survey in Japan, where participants were recruited in 2001 and are continuously followed. Methods: Suspended particulate matter (SPM), nitrogen dioxide, and sulfur dioxide concentrations during the 9 months before birth were obtained at municipality level and assigned to those participants born in the corresponding municipality. We analyzed data from singleton births with linked pollution data available (e.g., n = 33,911 for SPM). We used responses to survey questions about behavioral problems at age 8 years. We conducted multilevel logistic regression analysis, adjusting for individual and municipality-level variables. Results: Air pollution exposure during gestation was positively associated with risk for behavioral problems related to attention and delinquent or aggressive behavior. In the fully adjusted models, odds ratios following a one-interquartile-range increase in SPM were 1.06 (95% confidence interval: 1.01,1.11) for interrupting others, 1.09 (1.03,1.15) for failure to pay attention when crossing a street, 1.06 (1.01,1.11) for lying, and 1.07 (1.02,1.13) for causing public disturbance.

We thus examined associations between prenatal exposure to outdoor air pollution and child behavioral problems at school age, using data from a nationwide population-based longitudinal survey in Japan, where participants were recruited in 2001 and are continuously followed. Methods: Suspended particulate matter (SPM), nitrogen dioxide, and sulfur dioxide concentrations during the 9 months before birth were obtained at municipality level and assigned to those participants born in the corresponding municipality. We analyzed data from singleton births with linked pollution data available (e.g., n = 33,911 for SPM). We used responses to survey questions about behavioral problems at age 8 years. We conducted multilevel logistic regression analysis, adjusting for individual and municipality-level variables. Results: Air pollution exposure during gestation was positively associated with risk for behavioral problems related to attention and delinquent or aggressive behavior. In the fully adjusted models, odds ratios following a one-interquartile-range increase in SPM were 1.06 (95% confidence interval: 1.01,1.11) for interrupting others, 1.09 (1.03,1.15) for failure to pay attention when crossing a street, 1.06 (1.01,1.11) for lying, and 1.07 (1.02,1.13) for causing public disturbance. Conclusions: Prenatal exposure to outdoor air pollution was associated with behavioral problems related to attention and delinquent or aggressive behavior at age 8 years in a nationally representative sample in Japan.

We are interested in the private benefits to households, because they represent additional value of the program and likely drive adoption.

We also explore heterogeneous effects of the program by income group and energy poverty status. Our results suggest that, after controlling for observable characteristics of individuals and dwellings, users of pellet stoves on average enjoy 14 % lower indoor PM2.5 concentrations during hours in which stoves are in use compared with those who use traditional stoves during the same periods of time. Lower-income and energy-poor households receive much greater than average improvements in indoor air pollution than those with higher-incomes, driving the overall estimate and indicating that the program is progressive in this dimension.

While plenty is known about the spatial gradients of highway emissions, very little is known about variation of lay understanding at the fine spatial scale and whether there are gradients in severity of concerns. One-hundred and four near-highway residents agreed to participate in a semi-structured interview on their knowledge and attitudes towards highway traffic emissions. Proximity to the highway edge varied within 5-380. m at the predominantly downwind side of the highway and 13-483. m at the upwind side. Likert-type ordered response questions were analysed using multivariate regression. Inverse linear relationships were identified for distance from highway and measures of concern for health impacts, as well as for noise (p<0.05). Positive linear relationships were identified for distance from highway and ratings of both outdoor and indoor air quality (p<0.05). Measures of level of income had no conclusive statistically significant effect on perceptions. Additional discussion was made surrounding participant[U+05F3]s open-ended responses, within the context of limited international research.

The specific objectives of the study were as follows: to obtain information from public on their perception of the AQ in Ploiesti and Targoviste urban areas where they live, work or study; to explore the public interest level in AQ-related issues; to analyze public views on what types of AQ-related information is useful for their daily life; to discover if and how the public obtains existing AQ information; to explore if public are interested in obtaining more detailed AQ information; and to identify if public are willing to change their behavior and avoid exposure to air pollution. The target group was general public interested in AQ-related issues, including both professionals and normal citizens who are interested in air quality related issues. The sampling procedure used typical method applied on investigations in exploratory analyzes. The results revealed that people have a good understanding of key-drivers of air pollution but exists an apparent disconnect between theoretic knowledge and willings in changes of individual behavior.

It further highlights actions taken by individuals to mitigate associated health impacts. This cross sectional study was based on the Driver-Pressure-State-Impact-Response framework. A self-administered questionnaire was distributed to the public, a total sample size of 263 responses. Descriptive statistics, including frequencies and percentages of participants’ responses, were calculated. The Independent Samples t-test and a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) were applied along with the Chi-Square test to identify factors associated with the public’s knowledge and practices relating to PM2.5 in Bahrain. A p-value of less than 0.05 was considered as statistically significant. A significant proportion of the participants were unaware of PM2.5, its concentration in Bahrain, and whether it is being measured. However, the majority of respondents had respiratory problems and took self-protective measures when the air quality was bad. There were statistically significant differences in the adoption of precautionary measures, which was prevalent among participants suffering from respiratory problems. Around 32% of the respondents were willing to pay monthly contributions to improve air quality and indicated their interest in receiving information on Bahrain’s air quality via social and mass media.

Understanding awareness of air pollution and support for environmental protection from the general public is essential for informing governmental approaches to dealing with this problem. This study presents a cross-sectional survey conducted in the Klang Valley and Iskandar conurbations to examine urban Malaysians' perception, awareness and opinions of air pollution. The survey was conducted in two languages, English and Malay, and administered through the online survey research software, Qualtrics. The survey consisted of three sections, where we collected sociodemographic information, information on the public perception of air quality and the causes of air pollution, information on public awareness of air pollution and its related impacts, and information on attitudes towards environmental protection.

Understanding awareness of air pollution and support for environmental protection from the general public is essential for informing governmental approaches to dealing with this problem. This study presents a cross-sectional survey conducted in the Klang Valley and Iskandar conurbations to examine urban Malaysians' perception, awareness and opinions of air pollution. The survey was conducted in two languages, English and Malay, and administered through the online survey research software, Qualtrics. The survey consisted of three sections, where we collected sociodemographic information, information on the public perception of air quality and the causes of air pollution, information on public awareness of air pollution and its related impacts, and information on attitudes towards environmental protection. Of 214 respondents, over 60% were positive towards the air quality at both study sites despite the presence of harmful levels of air pollution.

We considered the disparity among gender, age and education level in four main aspects, viz. sources of access to information, knowledge and risk perception about air pollution and willingness to change and act for mitigation. Social media was a primary source of access to information regarding air pollution in Muscat. Further, the majority of the respondents were aware of the meaning of air pollution and interested in the issue of air quality, while females have a higher level of air pollution awareness than males. Over 94% of respondents were disturbed by air pollution from vehicles and other sources. Males and older participants have significantly higher level of interest about air quality information. The majority pay attention to air quality when they move outdoors but females are more susceptible than males to the effects of air pollution. Majority recognized the air pollution is always dangerous to their health, yet participants with higher education level have a higher risk perception of air pollution. Breathing contaminated air was the most common pathway of exposure to the toxic air pollutants reported by participants. Over 90% of participants care about air quality when they are performing outdoor sports activities. Most of the participants reported that they did not use public transportation to move within Muscat Governorate, their major transportation mode being private vehicle. Meanwhile, females, older participants (over 35) and postgraduate holders significantly expressed their willingness to reduce the duration of driving vehicles. Implications: This work is the first study in the country that try to investigate perception, attitude and behavior of the public about air pollution in Muscat, the capital of Oman. Use of private vehicles is a popular mode of transportation in the city and is the major contributor to the air quality issues.

In this regard, the intentions to use green and clean products and behavior has been estimated using the theory of planned behavior (TPB) in this study. The targeted population of the current study is the faculty of different public and private educational institutions in Lahore. The results of the study showed that attitude, perceived behavior control (PBC), and knowledge of people about using green products in reducing urban air pollution significantly affect their behavior. The core finding of this study was that subjective norms do not play a significant role in determining the intentions and behaviors with respect to clean and green products. The analysis has been done using IBM SPSS statistics 20 applying PCA (principal component analysis), linear regression model, and AMOS path analysis to analyze the TPB.

However, its influence on people's tendency to have children remains uncertain, as only a few studies have examined the correlation between public perception of air pollution and the desire to start a family. This article introduces a theoretical framework utilizing a two-stage interval iteration model to explore the connection between children's relative utility and the perception of air pollution. Data for this study were gathered from the Chinese General Social Survey (CGSS 2013). The CGSS 2013 project employed a four-stage stratified random sampling technique and conducted household interviews using questionnaires. The sample covered 28 provincial-level cities across China. The hypothesis was tested using a Probit regression model. The findings indicate that individuals considering air pollution a significant issue are 8.62% less likely to have more than one child. The variation in fertility desire sensitivity to air pollution points to heterogeneity among residents, such as registered residents and those living in various residential areas, as well as individuals with different characteristics like education levels. The study concludes that air quality significantly influences human fertility desire, highlighting the urgent necessity to raise awareness of environmental protection issues among both the public and authorities. In particular, there are two key steps to address this issue. Firstly, the government should establish clear air pollution control objectives and refine policies to enhance governance efficiency. Secondly, there is a need to encourage environmentally friendly behaviours among the public, promote more significant involvement in public environmental matters, and ensure effective oversight of the government's responsibilities in managing air pollution.",Fertility desire; Perception of air pollution; Relative utility of children; Two-stage interval iterative model; Probit regression; China,Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Child; China; Cities; Conservation of Natural Resources; Humans; Public Opinion; Research Design; air pollutant; air pollution; child; China; city; environmental protection; human; methodology; public opinion,AMBIENT AIR; HEALTH-RISKS,WOS,"Public perceptions of air pollution and its impacts on fertility desire: a nationwide study in China Over the past few years, there has been a significant focus on air pollution due to its various detrimental effects on human health.

In this paper, we conducted a systematic study on the coping behaviors of college students' outdoor physical exercise under the haze weather in Henan Province, China. The reference survey, questionnaire survey, interview, data measurement and data statistics were used to compile a questionnaire on the outdoor physical exercise response behavior of college students under the haze weather in Henan Province. The current situation of outdoor physical exercise response behaviors of ten universities in Henan Province under the haze weather was investigated. It was found that a total of 1,000 questionnaires were issued and 872 valid questionnaires were returned. The effective response rate was 87.2%. which has good validity. There is a positive con-elation between college students' perception of smog and college students' active participation in outdoor physical exercise. Most college students were able to actively participate in physical exercises under the haze weather, and the proportion of girls who chose to resist coping behavior was about 8.0% higher than that of boys (P<0.01). This result shows that female college students are more likely to give up outdoor physical exercise when encountering haze weather. Physical exercise behavior has little to do with age. Freshmen like to take risky coping behaviors, while seniors tend to resist coping behaviors. Students who rarely participate in physical exercises still choose to resist coping behaviors when faced with haze weather, while students who actively participate in physical exercises tend to choose risky coping behaviors. The students who choose to resist the coping behavior have the highest proportion of light participation in sports, about 29.41%. The students who choose risky coping behaviors are mostly non-persistent high-intensity physical exercises, accounting for about 49.45%. In a word, through this research, we can put forward suggestions for outdoor physical exercise in haze weather according to the different characteristics of college students, and finally find a new method suitable for college students' outdoor physical exercise coping behavior under haze weather.",Haze weather; college students; outdoor exercise; coping behavior; case analysis,,SYMPTOMS; QUALITY; LIFE,WOS,"RESEARCH ON COPING BEHAVIOR OFCOLLEGE STUDENTS' OUTDOOR PHYSICAL EXERCISES IN HAZE WEATHER With the rapid economic development of various countries, industrialization, marketization and urbanization have accelerated environmental pollution Smog air pollution not only affects the health of the people, but also causes serious losses to the country's economic development.

However, evidence-based guidance on effective personal behavioural strategies to minimise the effects of PM2.5 is limited. This study aimed to assess the effectiveness of a behavioural intervention in reducing PM2.5 exposure and improving clinical outcomes in patients with COPD.Materials and Methods: Participants were 1:1 randomised, and the intervention group received a behavioural intervention consisting of five activities, while the control group received usual care. The participants were followed up for 9 months. The primary outcomes were differences in the score of St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire for patients with COPD (SGRQ-C) and COPD assessment test (CAT) from baseline.Results: A total of 106 participants were enrolled and 102 completed the study. At the end of the study, the intervention group showed significant improvements in the primary outcomes compared to the control group, with a group difference of-5.9 in the reduction of total SGRQ-C (-3.4 vs. 2.5; p = 0.049) and-3.8 in the CAT score (-1.2 vs. 2.7; p = 0.001). Participants with good adherence to the intervention demonstrated a greater extent of improvement in CAT score and lower PM2.5 levels compared to those who had poor adherence or were in the control group.

This study aimed to assess the effectiveness of a behavioural intervention in reducing PM2.5 exposure and improving clinical outcomes in patients with COPD.Materials and Methods: Participants were 1:1 randomised, and the intervention group received a behavioural intervention consisting of five activities, while the control group received usual care. The participants were followed up for 9 months. The primary outcomes were differences in the score of St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire for patients with COPD (SGRQ-C) and COPD assessment test (CAT) from baseline.Results: A total of 106 participants were enrolled and 102 completed the study. At the end of the study, the intervention group showed significant improvements in the primary outcomes compared to the control group, with a group difference of-5.9 in the reduction of total SGRQ-C (-3.4 vs. 2.5; p = 0.049) and-3.8 in the CAT score (-1.2 vs. 2.7; p = 0.001). Participants with good adherence to the intervention demonstrated a greater extent of improvement in CAT score and lower PM2.5 levels compared to those who had poor adherence or were in the control group. Regular checking of air quality forecasts was significantly associated with a reduction in CAT scores among all the intervention activities.Conclusion: Individual-level behavioural interventions can be an effective strategy for mitigating the health hazards associated with PM2.5.ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04878367.

This study examined public attitudes and responses to the first two red warnings for air pollution in Beijing in 2015. An online survey was sent out, and 664 respondents (response rate = 90%) provided their perspectives on the red warnings. Descriptive statistics, sign tests and binary logit models were used to analyze the data. More than half of the respondents reported that their life and work were affected by the red warning in December 2015. In contrast to their perceptions about the second red warning period, the public thought that the first red warning should have been issued earlier and that the number of consecutive days of warnings should have been reduced. The respondents also recommended that instead of reducing the number of red warnings, the red warning emergency measures should be adjusted. Specifically, the public preferred the installation of air purifiers in schools rather than closing schools and strengthening road flushing and dust pollution controls over restrictions on driving. Data analyses were conducted to examine the affected groups and different groups' perceptions of the necessity of implementing emergency measures. The results indicated that men and more educated respondents were more likely to be affected by driving limitations, and men were less supportive of these limitations. The age and education of respondents were significantly negatively associated with the opinion that schools should be closed, whereas wealthier respondents were more supportive of school closings.

The eastern portions of the country are relatively insulated from the harmful effects of PM2.5 emissions due to northwest winds which cause air pollutants generated from coal-fired power plants to be carried out to the East Sea (Sea of Japan). Consequently, our sample group was divided into central, western, eastern, and southern regions, and a contingent valuation method, combined with a double-bounded dichotomous choice, was used to derive people's WTP for the mitigation of PM2.5 emissions. Our estimation results indicated that respondents who live in eastern regions showed a significantly lower WTP (about KRW 1280/month) than the mean WTP of other regions (above KRW 1337/month).

In Japan, although industrial- and traffic-related air pollution has been decreasing, concerns about particulate matter air pollution has been growing in recent years. In this study, we examined the effects of air pollution on symptoms and the health status of healthy subjects in Japan.MethodsParticipants (n=2887) who visited healthcare centers in Kumamoto or Niigata prefectures in February from 2010 to 2015 were asked to fill out a questionnaire, which was a self-completed booklet containing questions on the characteristics of participants, their respiratory symptoms, and questionnaires on their health status in February, May, and July. Generalized estimating equation analyses were performed to predict the factors associated with the symptoms and health status using two-week averages of air quality parameters obtained from 49 monitoring stations as independent variables.ResultsOnly allergy was associated with air quality in both areas. Prevalence of the other respiratory symptoms were correlated with air quality only in Kumamoto. The health statuses including the physical fitness', daily activities', and social activities' domains were related only to time spent outdoors. The overall health' was associated with time spent outdoors and concentrations of nitrogen dioxide and suspended particulate matters (SPM) in Kumamoto, and with temperatures and SPM in Niigata. The pain' score was correlated with temperature and carbon monoxide concentration only in Kumamoto. In Kumamoto, the quality of life (QoL)' was worse in those who spent shorter hours outdoors, were exposed to lower humidity, higher concentrations of oxidants, SPM, and PM2.5, and who experienced more Asian sand dust (ASD) events. In Niigata, a worsened QoL' was associated with time spent outdoors, temperature, and SPM.ConclusionsThe associations between air quality and the health status was found mainly in the comprehensive domain of the health status such as overall health' and QoL'.

Methods A questionnaire survey was conducted in Tianjin and Shijiazhuang by cluster sampling method. T-test was conducted for comparison analysis of the risk perception in different cities. Linear regression model and Logistic regression model were employed to explore the determining factors of public perception and preventive actions of air pollution respectively. Results A total of 3 902 valid questionnaires were screened out. The public with higher education and income in Tianjin were more familiar with air pollution, while the young women with higher education and income were more sensitive to the health impact caused by air pollution. There were geographical differences in the correlation between PM2 S average daily doses and public risk perception. The more the public in Tianjin trust the government, the more familiar they are with the risk of air pollution, the younger the public, the more likely it is to take measures towards air pollution. For the public in Shijiazhuang, the higher the level of education and the younger the population, the higher the willingness to take countermeasures.

Methods A questionnaire survey was conducted in Tianjin and Shijiazhuang by cluster sampling method. T-test was conducted for comparison analysis of the risk perception in different cities. Linear regression model and Logistic regression model were employed to explore the determining factors of public perception and preventive actions of air pollution respectively. Results A total of 3 902 valid questionnaires were screened out. The public with higher education and income in Tianjin were more familiar with air pollution, while the young women with higher education and income were more sensitive to the health impact caused by air pollution. There were geographical differences in the correlation between PM2 S average daily doses and public risk perception. The more the public in Tianjin trust the government, the more familiar they are with the risk of air pollution, the younger the public, the more likely it is to take measures towards air pollution. For the public in Shijiazhuang, the higher the level of education and the younger the population, the higher the willingness to take countermeasures. Conclusions The risk perception of air pollution was influenced by age, education level, and income level to a certain extent, and is related to the pollution prevention and control measures taken. The Tianjin public’ s risk perception was positively correlated with the average daily doses and concentration of PM2 5. © 2021, Publication Centre of Anhui Medical University. All rights reserved.

However, exposure-response models for this relationship have not been developed. One of the main challenges is to identify a compound that can be used as proxy for livestock odor exposure. In this paper we developed models that describe the relationship between long-term averaged outdoor residential ammonia (NH3) exposures and livestock odor annoyance experienced by rural residents, and investigated person-related variables associated with annoyance responses. We used emission-based atmospheric dispersion modeling data to estimate household-specific outdoor concentrations and survey data to characterize the study subjects. Binomial and multinomial logistic regressions were used for model development. Residential NH3 exposure was positively associated with moderate, high and extreme odor annoyance (adjusted odds ratio = 10.59: 95% confidence interval: 1.35-83.13, for each unit increase in Log(e)NH(3) exposure). Specific characteristics of the exposed subjects (i.e., age, time per week spent at home, presence of children at home and job) act as co-determinants of odor annoyance responses.

A questionnaire survey based on accidental sampling to explore risk perception and willingness to pay (WTP) for self-protection and haze management was conducted via face-to-face interview of 250 households, in one urban and four rural areas (covering one rural plain and three different levels of highland areas). Data were analyzed using the contingent valuation method, a one-way ANOVA, correlation, and stepwise multiple linear regression. Key findings on risk perception found that urban respondents living in the lowest areas were more familiar with and experienced more effects from serious haze, while having the least trust in the local authority's management to cope with the situation. Influential factors determining familiarity and effect for people in most areas were their harm and severe haze experiences. Comparing WTP for a mask, an air purifier, and local authorities support, respondents in all areas were mainly willing to pay for a mask; this was influenced by various factors. The highest average price of willingness to pay was found in the urban area. The important significant factors that increased WTP for self-protection of urban respondents was severe haze experience, while rural respondents who had a longer stay duration, including married farmers in highland areas with less education, tended to have less WTP for self-protection but more WTP for haze management.

Method: A cross-sectional convenience sample survey was conducted among 302 outdoor exercisers in May 2015. Descriptive analysis was used to describe demographics, outdoor physical activity patterns, knowledge of PM2.5 and risk reduction behaviors. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was then used to explore factors that influence the adoption of risk reduction behaviors. Results: The most common behavior to reduce PM2.5 exposure was minimizing the times for opening windows on hazy days (75.5%), and the least common one was using air purifiers (19.3%). Two thirds of respondents indicated that they wore face masks when going outside in the haze (59.5%), but only 13.6% of them would wear professional antismog face masks.

553,10.3390/ijerph191711068,Searching for New Human Behavior Model in the Climate Change Age: Analyzing the Impact of Risk Perception and Government Factors on Intention-Action Consistency in Particulate Matter Mitigation,"Shin, Y; Kim, S; Kim, S",2022,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH,19,17,"This study aims to analyze factors influencing citizens' intentions to take protective action against particulate matter (PM) and their actual actions in response to PM. There were few research on the role of government factors and the issue of intention-action inconsistency in the context of PM mitigation action. Therefore, this study set not only variables in the risk perception paradigm but also ones in government factors as independent variables, while intention and action in response to PM were set as dependent variables. This study's analysis was based on survey data collected from Korean people. For representativeness of the samples, this study adopted the quota sampling method, considering region, gender, and age. Five hundred respondents finished the survey. To verify the hypotheses, this study used regression and binomial logistic analysis. Analysis showed that (1) negative emotions, trust, knowledge, government competency, policy satisfaction, and policy awareness had significant effects on intention and action in response to PM, and (2) perceived benefits only affected intention, whereas government accountability only affected action. Logistic analysis showed that there were groups in which intentions and actions did not match.

There were few research on the role of government factors and the issue of intention-action inconsistency in the context of PM mitigation action. Therefore, this study set not only variables in the risk perception paradigm but also ones in government factors as independent variables, while intention and action in response to PM were set as dependent variables. This study's analysis was based on survey data collected from Korean people. For representativeness of the samples, this study adopted the quota sampling method, considering region, gender, and age. Five hundred respondents finished the survey. To verify the hypotheses, this study used regression and binomial logistic analysis. Analysis showed that (1) negative emotions, trust, knowledge, government competency, policy satisfaction, and policy awareness had significant effects on intention and action in response to PM, and (2) perceived benefits only affected intention, whereas government accountability only affected action. Logistic analysis showed that there were groups in which intentions and actions did not match.

Some argue that smoking restrictions or bans would result in a business drop, assuming > 50% of patrons smoke. Evidence in Nevada and responses from the 2008 California tobacco survey refute this assertion. The present study investigates the proportion of active smokers in southern California tribal casinos, as well as occupancy and PM2.5 levels in smoking and nonsmoking sections. Methods: We measured active-smoker and total-patron counts during Friday or Saturday night visits (two per casino) to smoking and nonsmoking gaming areas inside 11 southern California casinos. We counted slot machines and table games in each section, deriving theoretical maximum capacities and occupancy rates. We also measured PM2.5 concentrations (or used published levels) in both nonsmoking and smoking areas. Results: Excluding one casino visit with extremely high occupancy, we counted 24,970 patrons during 21 casino visits of whom 1,737 were actively smoking, for an overall active- smoker proportion of 7.0% and a small range of similar to 5% across casino visits (minimum of 5% and maximum of 10%). The differences in mean inter-casino active-smoker proportions were not statistically significant. Derived occupancy rates were 24% to 215% in the main (low-stakes) smoking-allowed slot or table areas. No relationship was found between observed active-smoker proportions and occupancy rate. The derived maximum capacities of nonsmoking areas were 1% to 29% of the overall casino capacity (most under 10%) and their observed occupancies were 0.1 to over 3 times that of the main smoking-allowed casino areas. Seven of twelve visits to nonsmoking areas with no separation had occupancy rates greater than main smoking areas. Unenclosed nonsmoking areas don't substantially protect occupants from PM2.5 exposure. Nonsmoking areas encapsulated inside smoking areas or in a separate, but unenclosed, area had PM2.5 levels that were 10 to 60 mu g/m(3) and 6 to 23 mu g/m(3) higher than outdoor levels, respectively, indicating contamination from smoking. Conclusions: Although fewer than roughly 10% of casino patrons are actively smoking on average, these individuals substantially increase PM2.5 exposure for all patrons in smoking and unenclosed nonsmoking areas. Nonsmoking areas may be too inconvenient, small, or undesirable to serve a substantial number of nonsmoking patrons. Imposing indoor smoking bans, or contained smoking areas with a maximum capacity of up to 10% of the total patronage, would offer protection from PM2.5 exposures for nonsmoking patrons and reduce employee exposures.",Secondhand smoke; Fine particles; Active smoker counts; Nonsmoking gaming,"Air Pollution, Indoor; California; Gambling; Humans; Particulate Matter; Smoking; Tobacco Smoke Pollution; MLCS; MLOWN; article; human; indoor air pollution; particulate matter; passive smoking; pathological gambling; smoking; United States",ENVIRONMENTAL TOBACCO-SMOKE; SECONDHAND SMOKE; AIR-POLLUTION; EXPOSURE,WOS,"Small proportions of actively-smoking patrons and high PM2.5 levels in southern California tribal casinos: support for smoking bans or designated smoking areas Background: Nearly all California casinos currently allow smoking, which leads to potentially high patron exposure to secondhand tobacco smoke pollutants.

The differences in mean inter-casino active-smoker proportions were not statistically significant. Derived occupancy rates were 24% to 215% in the main (low-stakes) smoking-allowed slot or table areas. No relationship was found between observed active-smoker proportions and occupancy rate. The derived maximum capacities of nonsmoking areas were 1% to 29% of the overall casino capacity (most under 10%) and their observed occupancies were 0.1 to over 3 times that of the main smoking-allowed casino areas. Seven of twelve visits to nonsmoking areas with no separation had occupancy rates greater than main smoking areas. Unenclosed nonsmoking areas don't substantially protect occupants from PM2.5 exposure. Nonsmoking areas encapsulated inside smoking areas or in a separate, but unenclosed, area had PM2.5 levels that were 10 to 60 mu g/m(3) and 6 to 23 mu g/m(3) higher than outdoor levels, respectively, indicating contamination from smoking. Conclusions: Although fewer than roughly 10% of casino patrons are actively smoking on average, these individuals substantially increase PM2.5 exposure for all patrons in smoking and unenclosed nonsmoking areas. Nonsmoking areas may be too inconvenient, small, or undesirable to serve a substantial number of nonsmoking patrons. Imposing indoor smoking bans, or contained smoking areas with a maximum capacity of up to 10% of the total patronage, would offer protection from PM2.5 exposures for nonsmoking patrons and reduce employee exposures.

This paper adopts a CV method framework to assess the value of WTP and analyze the determinants. Given the consideration of the possible presence of the selectivity bias caused by protest responses, the bivariate sample selection model is constructed for estimation. Results show that up to 14% of respondents hold the protest responses, and neglecting the selection bias caused by protest responses would lead to downward biased estimates. The mean value of WTP for the smog mitigation is 1590.36 RMB per year, accounting for about 1% of annual income. Moreover, the NIMBY (not in my backyard) attitude among public is found to be significantly correlated with their WTP, and the other determinants such as household annual income, energy expenditure and economic loss caused by smog could also substantially affect the value of WTP.

Risk perception is one of the most important indicators of the public's concern about air pollution. However, there existed few studies exploring the spatial distribution of risk perception. To fill the gap, psychometric paradigm methods was adopted to assess the public's risk perception of air pollution. A nationwide empirical study was conducted from December 2016 to February 2017 and 10,653 completed questionnaires were collected. According to a series of screening strategies, 9744 qualified questionnaires were included as a sample, which covered 31 China provinces (Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan were not included in this study). We found that 45% of the respondents were dissatisfied with the current air quality, many respondents concerned a lot about air pollution (76%) and worried about the harmful consequences of being exposed to air pollution (86%). There was significant difference in the public's risk perception and attitude toward air pollution among different regions: the respondents in the northeast region, northern coastal region, eastern coastal region and Middle Yellow river region perceived higher air pollution risk and lower satisfaction with air quality than other regions; and the public's trust in the government increased from coastal regions to inland regions. In addition, the hierarchical linear model (HLM) was used to explore the effects of demographic, environmental and economic factors on public risk perception and attitude toward air pollution. Based on this, the characteristics of sensitive populations regarding air pollution were identified. What's more, we found that PM2.5 has a positive influence on perceived risk factor (PR) and can strengthen the positive correlation between PR and satisfaction Iwith air quality (SAQ).

Our paper adopts a big data computational text analysis approach (keyword analysis, keyword co-occurrence, thematic analysis), based on a corpus of 2.4 million words, to compare concerns towards air pollution among three stakeholder groups (i.e. the government (GOV), the environmental groups (NGO) and the news media (MEDIA)) in Hong Kong, between 2002 and 2012, a period when air pollution was subject to rigorous policy debates and discussions. Our analysis shows the somewhat different concerns of the stakeholders. The stakeholders focus heavily on emissions and end-of-pipe pollution control.

577,,Survey on the use of a novel endonasal disposable device proposed in order to capture and eliminate air polluting particulate matter; [Sondaggio d'opinione sull'impiego di un innovativo dispositivo usa-e-getta endonasale per la cattura e l'eliminazione del particolato aerocontaminante],Narciso P.; Cantera E.; Picano A.; Allegra L.,2009,,63.0,5,"Foreword. It has recently been patented and presented a novel individual endonasal disposable medical device (temporarily named Smart Nose), consisting in a couple of small cone trunks with an internal helix (the entire tool in soft medical silicone), which ""captures"" and eliminates airborne particulate matter, in particular of polluting origin (PM) but also of allergic nature. Air clearance from such noxious particles has been assessed, as well as nasal resistances, with different configurations of the device, and consequently the most ""equilibrated"" geometry has been selected considering the best possible ""filtering"" efficiency vs the best possible respect of nasal respiratory patency. The ""capturing"" properties of the device are due to a special biogel stratified on the internal surface of each cone trunk and helix: such biogel captures PM due to its electrostatic properties, fixes it thank to its high viscosity and eliminates it (it's disposable). Aim. This paper presents the results of a survey on the opinion of a sample of citizens about the potential agreement on such individual defense from atmospheric pollutants and other airborne noxious particles. Subjects andmethod.The interwiewed persons were 279 common citizens transiently exposed to urban outdoor pollution, but also persons more ""sensible"" to pollution and airborne particle-derived problems: 19 citizens suffering from allergic oculorhinitis and bronchial asthma, 50 workers operating in an open urban context or unhealthy environment, plus 52 snorers not belonging to such last two categories. Results. The survey in general has demonstrated high interest of the interviewed persons towards Smart Nose: a positive impression has been referred by 70% common citizens, 84% allergics, 73% ""polluted"" workers. 46% snorers.

It has recently been patented and presented a novel individual endonasal disposable medical device (temporarily named Smart Nose), consisting in a couple of small cone trunks with an internal helix (the entire tool in soft medical silicone), which ""captures"" and eliminates airborne particulate matter, in particular of polluting origin (PM) but also of allergic nature. Air clearance from such noxious particles has been assessed, as well as nasal resistances, with different configurations of the device, and consequently the most ""equilibrated"" geometry has been selected considering the best possible ""filtering"" efficiency vs the best possible respect of nasal respiratory patency. The ""capturing"" properties of the device are due to a special biogel stratified on the internal surface of each cone trunk and helix: such biogel captures PM due to its electrostatic properties, fixes it thank to its high viscosity and eliminates it (it's disposable). Aim. This paper presents the results of a survey on the opinion of a sample of citizens about the potential agreement on such individual defense from atmospheric pollutants and other airborne noxious particles. Subjects andmethod.The interwiewed persons were 279 common citizens transiently exposed to urban outdoor pollution, but also persons more ""sensible"" to pollution and airborne particle-derived problems: 19 citizens suffering from allergic oculorhinitis and bronchial asthma, 50 workers operating in an open urban context or unhealthy environment, plus 52 snorers not belonging to such last two categories. Results. The survey in general has demonstrated high interest of the interviewed persons towards Smart Nose: a positive impression has been referred by 70% common citizens, 84% allergics, 73% ""polluted"" workers. 46% snorers. About 50% of the potential users are convinced about the utility of the device by the description of its characteriscics, others would prefer to test it in advance. Neither invasivity nor fear of unpleasant nasal sensations are likely to constitute a problem: a proposed costless proof is accepted by >90% of the sample, specially by younger people. Conclusion.

The aim of the paper was to determine the effect of visual smog on the buying behavior of the millennial generation. 210 respondents took part in the survey. The results show that almost three quarters of respondents report that they do not shop according to outdoor advertising. Almost a quarter of respondents report that they do not purchase from companies that use outdoor advertising. Just under 30% of respondents would stop buying from a company that contributes to outdoor advertising overload, showing so far relatively little impact of visual smog on brand perception in terms of reduced purchase tendencies. Visual smog is a trending topic in relation to outdoor spaces in cities, but in terms of visual experience, it is not just about the physical environment.

Questionnaires for primary school aged children have traditionally been parent-administered, but self-administered questionnaires would be easier to administer and may yield as good, if not better, information. Our aim was to compare the repeatability of self- and parent-administered indoor air questionnaires designed for primary school aged pupils. Methods: Indoor air questionnaire with questions on child's symptoms and perceived indoor air quality in schools was sent to parents of pupils aged 7-12 years in two schools and again after two weeks. Slightly modified version of the questionnaire was administered to pupils aged 9-12 years in another two schools and repeated after a week. 351 (52%) parents and 319 pupils (86%) answered both the first and the second questionnaire. Test-retest repeatability was assessed with intra-class correlation (ICC) and Cohen's kappa coefficients (k). Results: Test-retest repeatability was generally between 0.4-0.7 (ICC; k) in both self-and parent-administered questionnaire. In majority of the questions on symptoms and perceived indoor air quality test-retest repeatability was at the same level or slightly better in self-administered compared to parent-administered questionnaire.

Questionnaires for primary school aged children have traditionally been parent-administered, but self-administered questionnaires would be easier to administer and may yield as good, if not better, information. Our aim was to compare the repeatability of self- and parent-administered indoor air questionnaires designed for primary school aged pupils. Methods: Indoor air questionnaire with questions on child's symptoms and perceived indoor air quality in schools was sent to parents of pupils aged 7-12 years in two schools and again after two weeks. Slightly modified version of the questionnaire was administered to pupils aged 9-12 years in another two schools and repeated after a week. 351 (52%) parents and 319 pupils (86%) answered both the first and the second questionnaire. Test-retest repeatability was assessed with intra-class correlation (ICC) and Cohen's kappa coefficients (k). Results: Test-retest repeatability was generally between 0.4-0.7 (ICC; k) in both self-and parent-administered questionnaire. In majority of the questions on symptoms and perceived indoor air quality test-retest repeatability was at the same level or slightly better in self-administered compared to parent-administered questionnaire. Agreement of self-and parent administered questionnaires was generally < 0.4 (ICC; k) in reported symptoms and 0.4-0.6 (ICC; k) in perceived indoor air quality.

The effects of adding these K salts on SO2-SO3 conversion and on denitration behavior over the catalyst were studied, using reactor trials and various characterization methods, including NH3-TPD, H-2-TPR, ICP, BET, XRD, SEM, FT-IR and XPS. The results of catalytic activity evaluation tests show that adding K salts decreases the denitration efficiency, while SO2 enhances the activity of the KCl-poisoned catalyst to an extent. The presence of K salts also improves the SO3 formation rate, such that the SO3 formation rate for the K2SO4-poisoned catalyst is as high as 1.53% at 410 degrees C (compared with 0.60% for the fresh catalyst). The characterization data indicate that K salts aggregate on the catalyst surface, blocking the pores of the catalyst. The reduction ability of the catalyst is decreased slightly and new weakly acidic sites appear. In addition, the concentration of strongly acidic sites declines.

Based on the theory of planned behavior and from the perspective of subjective perception, this paper uses a regulated model to explore the impact mechanism of air pollution perception on young talent urban settlement intentions. Taking Hangzhou as a case, this study surveyed 987 individuals who were classified as young talent to explore the impact of air pollution perception on urban settlement intentions in China. The research shows that air pollution perception has a significant impact on young talent urban settlement intentions, and this impact is achieved through the intermediary effect of residential satisfaction. Place attachment of young talent to cities cannot significantly regulate the impact of air pollution perception on residential satisfaction, but it can significantly regulate the relationship between residential satisfaction and urban settlement intentions.

Data were collected (n = 2010) from 13 Chinese cities with varying air pollution gradients using questionnaires. The results demonstrated that air pollution was significantly correlated with people's risk perception and concern about air pollution, which significantly affected their pro-environmental behaviour (PEB). However, high-risk perceptions undermine the public's self-efficacy and reduce people's PEB in the private sphere. People with high scores of the authoritarian personality type were reluctant to engage in PEB in the private sphere; interestingly, it can also be transformed into a stronger PEB in the public sphere via social norms.

Using large-scale geo-referenced survey data, collected in the Bohai Rim area of China (including 43 cities), we found that a standard deviation decrease in the number of polluted days over a year was associated with about a 15 percent increase in the odds of reporting a higher degree of happiness, after controlling for a wide range of individual- and city-scale covariate effects. On average, urban residents in the Bohai Rim region were willing to pay roughly 1.42 percent of their average monthly household income for mitigating marginal reductions in air pollution, although great spatial variability was also presented.

On this basis, an assessment was made of the extent to which information on the condition of air quality in a given city is relevant for persons planning a tourist trip. In the conducted research, decisions regarding both business and private trips were evaluated. In addition, information on factors that could increase the respondents' interest in the condition of air quality in the city of the intended trip (e.g., trip with children, trip length) was collected. Due to the fact that tourism is a significant source of income for many cities, the research results presented in the article may be of significant importance for entities creating the urban tourist product and responsible for its management. The article also draws attention to the fact that reducing pollution in cities can contribute to increases in their tourist attractiveness. city tourism; tourist attractiveness; tourism management; air pollution; sustainable tourism Poland [Central Europe]; air quality; atmospheric pollution; business development; debt for nature swap; ecotourism; environmental impact; perception; public attitude; tourism management; tourist attraction URBAN TOURISM; CO2 EMISSIONS; COMPETITIVENESS; DESTINATIONS; EUROPE; IMPACT; IMAGE","```json

Emissions of fine particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter of <= 2.5 mu m (PM2.5) increase smog and air pollution, with strong impacts on human health. Children are particularly vulnerable. While increasing studies are being conducted on the behaviors leading to PM2.5 toxicity from the perspective of environmental toxicants, there is a lack of research on factors influencing anti-PM2.5 behavioral intentions. Thus, this study aims to narrow this gap by adapting the theory of planned behavior framework to investigate the effects of attitude, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control on protective behavioral intentions against PM2.5. In total, 1277 online questionnaires were collected from parents of young children living in urban and rural areas of Beijing, and the data was analyzed using correlation, regression, and path analyses.

Urban air pollution is created by the failure of the public and the environment to respond to the amount of waste produced in relatively small areas throughout high population density and concentration. The intention of this study was to examine the effect of selected factors (perceived vulnerability, perceived severity, self-efficacy and response efficacy) on adaptive behaviour to urban air pollution. The respondents (N = 450) answered a face-to-face questionnaire survey. The results reveal support for the proposed model, with perceived vulnerability (H1) and self-efficacy (H3) positively predicting adaptive behavioural responses towards urban air quality. The findings specify that there is a significant relationship between perceived vulnerability (ß = 0.246, t = 4.534, P=0.000) and self-efficacy (ß = 0.510, t = 9.653, P=0.000) to adaptive behaviour of the urban community.

Mass and number concentrations of particles, concentration of volatile organic compounds, microbes and CO2 were measured. Samples of accumulated dust and microbial count were taken from inner duct surfaces, and ventilation rate and air flows were measured. A questionnaire survey (MM-40-FIN) of work environment and possible symptoms among office workers was carried out. The measurements and the survey were conducted a few days before the duct cleaning and at least one month after the cleaning. Duct cleaning had no detectable effect on measured supply and indoor air quality. The average air flows exceeded 20 L/s per person before and after duct cleaning. The average amount of dust on the inner duct surfaces decreased significantly from 8.4 ± 9.1 g/m2 to 1.9 ± 2.1 g/m2. The viable microbial count on the inner duct surface on malt extract agar decreased about 70% and on dichloran glycerol agar 90%. TVOC concentration in supply air decreased about 31%, but this may have been caused by the changes in outdoor air TVOC concentrations. Settled dust on inner surfaces of ventilation systems did not significantly adsorb or desorb chemical compounds. The ventilation system acted as a source for some individual compounds and for some of them the source strength was even higher after the cleaning. However, the emissions of these VOCs were low. Duct cleaning had a positive impact on perceived work environment and prevalence of the work-related symptoms in studied offices. The most significant improvements in work environment factors due to duct cleaning were detected with stuffy ""bad"" air (p < 0.001) and work-related nasal symptoms (p < 0.01). Although the studied offices were located in non-problem buildings, the prevalence of work-related symptoms was frequent before duct cleaning. This study showed that effects of ventilation system cleaning on indoor air quality are difficult to measure in non-problem buildings. However, the employees experienced improvement in the work environment and showed fewer symptoms after duct cleaning. It is suggested that duct cleaning and re-balancing of air flows should be performed as part of regular maintenance of mechanical supply and exhaust ventilation systems, also in office buildings in which indoor air quality follows guideline values.

Despite the negative health impacts of smog pollution, individual adaptive behaviors are poorly understood. This knowledge gap hinders the development of effective public policy to support and encourage the adoption of individual adaptive and mitigating behaviors to smog pollution.

Results showed that although park visits would decrease with increase of pollution, the level of behavior change was not enough to avoid adverse health impact. During slight pollution (75-115 mu g/m3), 93.4% respondents would visit a park as planned. The proportion reduced to 71.0 % for moderate pollution (115-150 mu g/m3), greatly decreased to 38.7% for heavy pollution (150-250 mu g/ m3), and 34.1% for severe pollution (> 250 mu g/m3).

To develop an effective strategy to reduce PM exposure, we performed detailed questionnaire surveys regarding the type of lifestyle required to avoid PM exposure in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). We correlated the data with real-time PM concentration during the winter season. Methods: We enrolled 104 patients with COPD aged 40 years or older. Detailed questionnaire surveys were conducted among participants, and internet of things-based sensors were installed at their homes to measure the indoor PM2.5 concentration, which was continuously monitored between December 2019 and February 2020. The associations among PM2.5 concentration, patients' lifestyles, and the impact of both concentration and lifestyle on COPD exacerbation were analyzed. Results: Mean outdoor PM2.5 concentration was higher than mean indoor PM2.5 concentration during the study period (21.28 +/- 5.09 mu g/m3 vs. 12.75 +/- 7.64 mu g/m3), with a mean difference of 8.53 +/- 7.99 mu g/m3. Among the various social factors and practices that aim to avoid exposure to PM, six practices and economic statuses were confirmed to reduce indoor PM2.5 concentration compared to outdoor concentration; Contrarily, these practices created a significant difference between the outdoor and indoor PM2.5 concentrations. The six practice items that showed a significant difference were 1) checking air quality forecast (the difference: -13.31 +/- 1.35 mu g/m3, p = 0.013), 2) indoor air filter operated (-15.43 +/- 1.32 mu g/m3, p 0.001), 3) ventilating home by opening the windows (-13.14 +/- 1.28 mu g/m3, p = 0.013), 4) checking filters of the air filter (-13.95 +/- 1.50 mu g/m3, p = 0.002), 5) refraining from going out when outside PM is high (-12.52 +/- 1.37 mu g/m3, p = 0.039), 6) wearing a mask when going out (-13.38 +/- 1.32 mu g/m3, p = 0.017).

However, it is rich in natural resources that could support the development of solar energy, wind energy, and other renewable clean energies, making it a typical example of a region suitable for energy structure transformation. On the basis of environmental statistical data, field surveys, and data from the Shaanxi Provincial Bureau of Statistics, this study developed an inventory of anthropogenic source emissions of seven pollutants in 2017 in Shaanxi Province. In accordance with the established inventory, various scenarios were considered to analyze the impact of energy structure transformation on air pollutant emissions. In comparison with the Business-as-Usual scenario, the comprehensive clean energy use scenario reduced SO2, NOx, CO, PM10, PM2.5, VOCs, NH3 and CO2 emissions by 32.50%, 33.10%, 14.56%, 26.64%, 16.72%, 2.88%, 4.36% and 36.85%, respectively. Ambitious development of clean energy, such as wind and solar, could greatly reduce the emission of air pollutants, especially CO2, SO2 and NOx, that are derived mainly from fossil fuel combustion, showing that strict control of the energy structure could reduce pollutant emissions.

To achieve global climate-governance goals, it is essential to accelerate the process of peaking carbon emissions and meeting air-quality standards. Despite growing awareness of the impact of low-carbon city policies on the environment, few studies have focused on their impact on urban air quality. Based on panel data drawn from 275 cities between 2011 and 2017, the present study evaluates the effects of a low-carbon city policy on urban sulfur-dioxide emissions, using the low-carbon city policy as a quasi-natural experiment. The findings reveal that urban sulfur-dioxide emissions have obvious spatial-autocorrelation characteristics, showing obvious spatial clustering. The low-carbon city policy not only significantly reduced urban sulfur-dioxide emissions in pilot cities, but also suppressed sulfur-dioxide emissions in surrounding cities through an indirect rebound effect. This paper provides a theoretical reference for collaborative governance, which can help to achieve peak carbon emissions and air-quality standards. To reach those goals, nations must abandon territorial prevention-and-control methods based on administrative divisions and to fully activate cross-city regional joint prevention-and-control measures.

Therefore, to investigate these questions, we conducted a systematic survey of 24 PFAS in 11 paired water and SPM samples from the SML and underlying water (U-50cm and U-2m) from the Duliujian River, which flows to the Bohai sea in Tianjin, China. The Sigma PFAS mean concentrations in the water and SPM samples were 38.2 ng/L and 64.6 ng/g dw, respectively. The PFAS concentrations of PFAS in the SML were higher than those in the underlying water, and the enrichment factors (EFs) were greater in the SPM than that in the water. The long-chain PFAS EFs were greater than those for short-chain PFAS, indicating that the EFs were positively correlated with the hydrophobicity.

Awareness about the potential health impacts of air pollution from industry can influence people's risk perception. This in turn can affect (self-reported) symptoms. Our aims were to investigate the associations of air pollution from heavy industry with health symptoms and to evaluate whether these associations are mediated by people's risk perception about local industry. Methods A cross-sectional questionnaire study was conducted among children (2-18 years) and adults (19 years and above) living in the direct vicinity of an area with heavy industry. A dispersion model was used to characterize individual-level exposures to air pollution emitted from the industry in the area. Associations between PM2.5 and NOx with presence of chronic diseases (adults) and respiratory symptoms (adults and children) were investigated by logistic regression analysis. Risk perception was indirectly measured by worries about local industry (0-10 scale). Mediation analyses were performed to investigate the role of mediation by these worries. Results The response was 54% (2,627/4,877). In adults exposure to modelled PM2.5 from industry (per mu g/m(3)) was related with reported high blood pressure (OR 1.56, 95% CI 1.13-2.15) and exposure to modelled NOx (per mu g/m(3)) was inversely related with cardiovascular diseases (OR 0.91, 95% CI 0.84-0.98). In children higher PM2.5 and NOx concentrations (per mu g/m(3)) were related with wheezing (OR 2.00, 95% CI 1.24-3.24 and OR 1.13, 95% CI 1.06-1.21 respectively) and dry cough (OR 2.33, 95% CI 1.55-3.52 and OR 1.16, 95% CI 1.10-1.22 respectively).

This scoping review aimed to identify previous research evaluating individuals' perceptions of air pollution and its health effects, and to explore the measurement of perceptions, as a key resource for health behaviour.MethodsThe review followed the methodological framework proposed by Arksey and O'Malley. PubMed and Web of Science were searched. After initial and full-text screening, we further selected studies with standardised scales that had previously been tested for reliability and validity in assessing awareness and perceptions.ResultsAfter full-text screening, 95 studies were identified. 'Perception/awareness of air quality' was often measured, as well as 'Perception of health risk.' Only nine studies (9.5%) used validated scaled questionnaires. There was considerable variation in the scales used to measure the multiple dimensions of risk perception for air pollution.ConclusionFew studies used structured scales to quantify individuals' perceptions, limiting comparisons among studies.

This scoping review aimed to identify previous research evaluating individuals' perceptions of air pollution and its health effects, and to explore the measurement of perceptions, as a key resource for health behaviour.MethodsThe review followed the methodological framework proposed by Arksey and O'Malley. PubMed and Web of Science were searched. After initial and full-text screening, we further selected studies with standardised scales that had previously been tested for reliability and validity in assessing awareness and perceptions.ResultsAfter full-text screening, 95 studies were identified. 'Perception/awareness of air quality' was often measured, as well as 'Perception of health risk.' Only nine studies (9.5%) used validated scaled questionnaires. There was considerable variation in the scales used to measure the multiple dimensions of risk perception for air pollution.ConclusionFew studies used structured scales to quantify individuals' perceptions, limiting comparisons among studies.

China's air pollution has reached the hazardous level since 2000s. In consideration of the serious health and social problems, residential demand for clean air is increasing. This paper applies the Contingent Valuation method to estimate public's willingness to pay (WTP) for reducing air pollution in the urban area of China. Open-ended scenarios through face-to-face surveys are used to elicit public's WTP. The Two-Part model is employed for the estimation: the probit model is used to estimate the probability of respondents who have positive WTP values, and the interval regression model is employed to estimate the specific WTP level of those with nonzero WTP values. The results show that nearly 90% of the respondents are willing to pay for reducing air pollution, and the average amount of WTP per individual is 382.6RMB per year. Household income is found to be positively correlated with people's WTP, and those who trust the government are more willing to share the cost of reducing air pollution.

We considered individual-level and community-level variables that may affect perceived air quality, such as the percentage of college-educated individuals aged >20 years, satisfaction with public transportation, and the percentage of individuals below the poverty line. Measured air quality showed a negative or neutral relationship with perceived air quality. We found that the degree of perceived air pollution was associated with younger age (20-34 years; OR = 1.40, 95% CI = 1.18-1.65), married and divorced/separated/widowed people, a higher level of education (>17 years; OR = 1.67, 95% CI = 1.30-2.15), and lower household income.

One way to lessen the health effects of air pollution is to change personal travel behaviour with the help of new information, communication and sensing technologies. Our social research tracked the experiences of participants, air quality and technology enthusiasts, based in London who financially contributed to participate in an early-stage technical trial of a new air pollution sensor and app providing individuals with air pollution information (specifically levels of NO2 and VOCs). This paper reports the results of a before and after survey (returning respondents n=22) and 12 in-depth interviews with individuals who took part in the beta test of the sensor and phone app. The survey results show that travel-related behaviours and attitudes relevant to air pollution did not change after using the technology. In contrast, expectations of technology performance and the extent it would influence behaviours were significantly lower after the trial than before. Further exploration during semi-structured interviews found that the participants, given their already high level of engagement with the topic, felt the capacity for immediate individual behaviour change was limited. As well as time and practical constraints, most people in this sample felt they were already doing what they could to avoid high levels of air pollution in their daily lives. Despite this, they had some recommendations to improve the app, such as the inclusion of real-time and historic maps, and the ability to make self and other comparisons.

Existing studies often focus on passive defense and ignore active strategies such as air purifiers, dehumidifiers, anti-haze window screens, and air-purifying plants. This study adopted the Knowledge–Attitude–Behavior (KAB) model to explore the factors that influence residents to take proactive measures to prevent the impacts of air pollution. This cross-sectional study recruited 371 participants aged 25–64 years living in southern Taiwan. A one-shot online survey was conducted to examine demographic information, air pollution exposure experience, knowledge, risk perceptions, attitudes toward air pollution protective measures, perceived barriers and benefits, payment for protective measures, and actual engagement in protective actions. Structural equation modeling was used to examine the relationships among these factors. This study reveals that the adoption of these protective measures can be understood through three primary pathways. The first pathway linked knowledge to attitude toward behavior. Regarding the various protective measures, this study found that knowledge strongly influenced individuals’ attitudes. This, in turn, influenced their likelihood of engaging in protective measures. The second pathway revealed the effect of risk perception on protective measures, with attitudes mediating this relationship. Perceived risk susceptibility and risk severity were linked to attitudes, which further influenced the adoption of protective measures. The third pathway emphasized the direct effects of perceived barriers on the adoption of protective measures. Individuals who perceived fewer barriers were more likely to adopt these measures. This study fills the gap in the understanding of the factors influencing residents’ adoption of proactive air pollution protection measures. Moreover, this study underscores the importance of increasing public awareness and reducing barriers to promote individual actions for mitigating the negative effects of air pollution. © The Author(s) 2024.",Attitude; Knowledge; Perceived barriers; Protective measures; Risk perception,"Adult; Air Pollution; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Surveys and Questionnaires; Taiwan; adult; air pollution; attitude to health; cross-sectional study; female; human; male; middle aged; questionnaire; Taiwan",,Scopus,"Understanding factors influencing adoption of air pollution protective measures using the knowledge-attitude-behavior model To address air pollution hazards effectively, it is crucial to understand the factors that influence residents’ adoption of harm reduction measures.

Traditional stationary monitoring often falls short of accurately capturing public air quality perceptions, prompting the need for alternative strategies. Leveraging an extensive dataset of over 20,000 public visibility perception evaluations and over 8,000 stationary images, our models effectively quantify diverse air quality perceptions. The predictive prowess of our models was validated by strong performance metrics for perceived visibility (R = 0.98, RMSE = 0.19), all-day PM2.5 concentrations (R: 0.77–0.78, RMSE: 8.31–9.40), and Central Weather Bureau visibility records (R = 0.82, RMSE = 9.00). Interestingly, image contrast and light intensity hold greater importance than scenery clarity in the visibility perception model. However, clarity is prioritized in PM2.5 and Central Weather Bureau models. Our research also unveiled spatial limitations in stationary monitoring and outlined the variations in predictive image features between near and far stations. Crucially, all models benefit from the characterization of atmospheric light sources through defogging techniques. The image-based insights highlight the disparity between public perception of air pollution and current policy implementation. In other words, policymakers should shift from solely emphasizing the reduction of PM2.5 levels to also incorporating the public's perception of visibility into their strategies.

Findings from measurements and surveys underline the significant and measurable impacts of MSW facilities on the ambient air quality of university residents. The analysis revealed a marked increase in concentrations of key pollutants, including carbon monoxide (CO), hydrogen sulfide (H2S), dust, and methane (CH4). At sampling point N1, H2S levels rose from 0 ppm in July to 13 ppm in November. Methane increased from 0.2% to 2.5% of the Lower Explosive Limit (LEL) at the same point, although it remained within safety limits. Additionally, CO levels showed a 40% increase, and dust concentration levels rose from 0.21 mg/m3 to 2.36 mg/m3 from summer to winter, indicating a seasonal variation likely influenced by the landfill's operational dynamics, as well as changes in temperature and relative humidity. In particular, the results indicate high concentrations of CO, H2S and dust, which are directly related to air quality degradation. The study also sheds light on the impacts of these waste disposal facilities on the general well-being and health of the university community, particularly on students and staff. In addition to these findings, the study highlights a general lack of awareness in the university community about the impacts of MSW facilities on air quality. This highlights the need for increased education and information dissemination. The results support the development of comprehensive and effective strategies, including technical solutions and public awareness initiatives, to mitigate the impacts of these facilities on residential areas.

We describe a new probabilistic modelling framework (INDAIR-2/EXPAIR), which provides predictions of the personal exposure frequency distribution (PEFD) across a city to assess the effects of both reduced emissions from home sources and reduced roadside concentrations on population exposure. The model uses a national time activity database, which gives the percentage of each population group in different residential and non-residential micro-environments, and links this, for the home, to predictions of concentrations from a three-compartment model, and for non-residential microenvironments to empirical indoor/outdoor ratios. This paper presents modelled PEFDs for NO2 in the city of Leicester, for children, the elderly, and office workers, comparing results in different seasons and on different days of the week. While the mean NO2 population exposure was close to, or below the urban background concentration, the 95%ile of the PEFD was well above the urban background concentration. The relationship between both mean and 95%ile PEFD and urban background concentrations was strongly influenced by air exchange rate.

667,10.1289/EHP11095,Using Parametric g-Computation to Estimate the Effect of Long-Term Exposure to Air Pollution on Mortality Risk and Simulate the Benefits of Hypothetical Policies: The Canadian Community Health Survey Cohort (2005 to 2015),Chen C.; Chen H.; van Donkelaar A.; Burnett R.T.; Martin R.V.; Chen L.; Tjepkema M.; Kirby-Mcgregor M.; Li Y.; Kaufman J.S.; Benmarhnia T.,2023,,131.0,3,"BACKGROUND: Numerous epidemiological studies have documented the adverse health impact of long-term exposure to fine particulate matter [particulate matter ≤2:5 lm in aerodynamic diameter (PM2:5)] on mortality even at relatively low levels. However, methodological challenges remain to consider potential regulatory intervention’s complexity and provide actionable evidence on the predicted benefits of interventions. We pro-pose the parametric g-computation as an alternative analytical approach to such challenges. METHOD: We applied the parametric g-computation to estimate the cumulative risks of nonaccidental death under different hypothetical intervention strategies targeting long-term exposure to PM2:5 in the Canadian Community Health Survey cohort from 2005 to 2015. On both relative and absolute scales, we explored the benefits of hypothetical intervention strategies compared with the natural course that a) set the simulated exposure value at each follow-up year to a threshold value if exposure was above the threshold (8:8 lg=m3, 7:04 lg=m3, 5 lg=m3, and 4 lg=m3), and b) reduced the simulated exposure value by a percentage (5% and 10%) at each follow-up year. We used the 3-y average PM2:5 concentration with 1-y lag at the postal code of respondents’ annual mailing addresses as their long-term exposure to PM2:5. We considered baseline and time-varying confounders, including demographics, behavior characteristics, income level, and neighborhood socioeconomic status. We also included the R syntax for reproduci-bility and replication. RESULTS: All hypothetical intervention strategies explored led to lower 11-y cumulative mortality risks than the estimated value under the natural course without intervention, with the smallest reduction of 0.20 per 1,000 participants (95% CI: 0.06, 0.34) under the threshold of 8:8 lg=m3, and the largest reduction of 3.40 per 1,000 participants (95% CI: −0:23, 7.03) under the relative reduction of 10% per interval. The reductions in cumulative risk, or numbers of deaths that would have been prevented if the intervention was employed instead of maintaining the status quo, increased over time but flattened toward the end of the follow-up period. Estimates among those ≥65 years of age were greater with a similar pattern. Our estimates were robust to different model specifications. DISCUSSION: We found evidence that any intervention further reducing the long-term exposure to PM2:5 would reduce the cumulative mortality risk, with greater benefits in the older population, even in a population already exposed to low levels of ambient PM2:5. The parametric g-computation used in this study provides flexibilities in simulating real-world interventions, accommodates time-varying exposure and confounders, and estimates adjusted survival curves with clearer interpretation and more information than a single hazard ratio, making it a valuable analytical alternative in air pollution epidemiological research. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP11095. © 2023, Public Health Services, US Dept of Health and Human Services.

On both relative and absolute scales, we explored the benefits of hypothetical intervention strategies compared with the natural course that a) set the simulated exposure value at each follow-up year to a threshold value if exposure was above the threshold (8:8 lg=m3, 7:04 lg=m3, 5 lg=m3, and 4 lg=m3), and b) reduced the simulated exposure value by a percentage (5% and 10%) at each follow-up year. We used the 3-y average PM2:5 concentration with 1-y lag at the postal code of respondents’ annual mailing addresses as their long-term exposure to PM2:5. We considered baseline and time-varying confounders, including demographics, behavior characteristics, income level, and neighborhood socioeconomic status. We also included the R syntax for reproduci-bility and replication. RESULTS: All hypothetical intervention strategies explored led to lower 11-y cumulative mortality risks than the estimated value under the natural course without intervention, with the smallest reduction of 0.20 per 1,000 participants (95% CI: 0.06, 0.34) under the threshold of 8:8 lg=m3, and the largest reduction of 3.40 per 1,000 participants (95% CI: −0:23, 7.03) under the relative reduction of 10% per interval. The reductions in cumulative risk, or numbers of deaths that would have been prevented if the intervention was employed instead of maintaining the status quo, increased over time but flattened toward the end of the follow-up period. Estimates among those ≥65 years of age were greater with a similar pattern. Our estimates were robust to different model specifications. DISCUSSION: We found evidence that any intervention further reducing the long-term exposure to PM2:5 would reduce the cumulative mortality risk, with greater benefits in the older population, even in a population already exposed to low levels of ambient PM2:5. The parametric g-computation used in this study provides flexibilities in simulating real-world interventions, accommodates time-varying exposure and confounders, and estimates adjusted survival curves with clearer interpretation and more information than a single hazard ratio, making it a valuable analytical alternative in air pollution epidemiological research. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP11095. © 2023, Public Health Services, US Dept of Health and Human Services.

668,10.1371/journal.pone.0161085,Using qualitative and quantitative methods to choose a habitat quality metric for air pollution policy evaluation,Rowe E.C.; Ford A.E.S.; Smart S.M.; Henrys P.A.; Ashmore M.R.,2016,,11.0,8,"Atmospheric nitrogen (N) deposition has had detrimental effects on species composition in a range of sensitive habitats, although N deposition can also increase agricultural productivity and carbon storage, and favours a few species considered of importance for conservation. Conservation targets are multiple, and increasingly incorporate services derived from nature as well as concepts of intrinsic value. Priorities vary. How then should changes in a set of species caused by drivers such as N deposition be assessed? We used a novel combination of qualitative semi-structured interviews and quantitative ranking to elucidate the views of conservation professionals specialising in grasslands, heathlands and mires. Although conservation management goals are varied, terrestrial habitat quality is mainly assessed by these specialists on the basis of plant species, since these are readily observed. The presence and abundance of plant species that are scarce, or have important functional roles, emerged as important criteria for judging overall habitat quality. However, species defined as 'positive indicator-species' (not particularly scarce, but distinctive for the habitat) were considered particularly important. Scarce species are by definition not always found, and the presence of functionally important species is not a sufficient indicator of site quality. Habitat quality as assessed by the key informants was rank-correlated with the number of positive indicator-species present at a site for seven of the nine habitat classes assessed. Other metrics such as species-richness or a metric of scarcity were inconsistently or not correlated with the specialists' assessments. We recommend that metrics of habitat quality used to assess N pollution impacts are based on the occurrence of, or habitat- suitability for, distinctive species. Metrics of this type are likely to be widely applicable for assessing habitat change in response to different drivers.

Estimations using natural language processing techniques,"Madjar, A; Gjorshoska, I; Prodanova, J; Dedinec, A; Kocarev, L",2023,ECOLOGICAL INFORMATICS,75,,"Air pollution remains a severe concern in European countries, especially in Western Balkan, where the air monitoring data point to harmful ambient pollution. The public concern with this issue becomes particularly critical during the fall and winter months, when the contamination is more visible, provoking a series of reactions directed principally to the government authorities as the responsible entities for regulating air pollution levels. Since citizen-contributed data are generally considered valuable additional information for assessing the impacts of air pollution, the public contribution could act as a tool for increasing awareness and response about air pollution. Consequently, this study's objective focuses on researching public awareness of air pollution in Western Balkan. The study assumes that citizens' reactions will grow more intensely during the months with an increase in air pollution levels, principally due to winter heating. Therefore, Twitter activity and news articles related to air pollution have been investigated for the case of Macedonia, Serbia, Bosnia and Herzegovina and Montenegro, from November 2021 to March 2022. Natural Language Processing techniques such as sentiment analysis, topic modelling, and cross-correlations statistical analysis were employed to determine the relationship between Twitter discussions and news with actual PM10 levels measured by official air monitoring stations. The aim was to observe whether tweets and news teasers reflect the realistic air pollution situation. The results affirm that social media discussions, mainly with a negative connotation, can serve as a measure of public awareness of temporal changes in the PM10 concentration in the air and the negative consequences. The content of the resources reveals several topics of concern, contributing to better identification of public opinion and possibilities for tracking news trends. Nevertheless, attention should be paid to news interpretation, provided that sometimes they might offer a more neutral understanding of the situation, failing, in this way, to present the actual air conditions and possibly impacting society in forming an unrealistic opinion. Additionally, the public might not be able to obtain sufficient or accurate information about the primary sources of air pollution, emphasizing the need for more transparent communication and greater education regarding air pollution monitoring. Finally, the study provides deeper insights into the content of the data and helps detect the reasons for skepticism towards proenvironmental behavior occurring in social media discussions.

We argue that severe air pollution conveys new information to the Chinese people, enhancing their understanding of the deficiencies in authoritarian governance and reducing the support of environmentally-aware individuals for the government. In other words, the impact of environmental awareness on political trust depends on the gravity of air pollution.

We argue that severe air pollution conveys new information to the Chinese people, enhancing their understanding of the deficiencies in authoritarian governance and reducing the support of environmentally-aware individuals for the government. In other words, the impact of environmental awareness on political trust depends on the gravity of air pollution. When people perceive air pollution as severe, it can directly cause those who are environmentally conscious to reduce their trust in the government.

Non-market valuation in the presence of dependencies,Evans M.F.; Poulos C.; Kerry Smith V.,2011,,62.0,1,Individuals who are likely to realize the largest benefits from improvements in air quality often depend on other members of their households to make time or monetary contributions to their care. The presence of these dependency relationships among household members poses challenges for benefit estimation since it is unlikely that the conditions necessary for recovering the underlying individual preferences from household choices are satisfied in this setting. We propose a conceptual framework that highlights the role of these dependencies in the choice models used to estimate the willingness to pay for environmental quality improvements. We design a complementary stated preference survey that describes hypothetical dependency relationships for household members of different ages to test the implications of our conceptual model.

The different effects of demographic variables on the dimensions of smog-induced health risk perception were investigated through 715 questionnaires distributed to skilled workers living in areas polluted by smog. The results showed that smog-induced health risk perception is a two-dimensional concept.

Change in life expectancy was well understood and the results showed that 78.2% of respondents were able to express their WTP. The mean WTP to save one Year of Life Loss (YOLL) is approximately 920 (sic) per person per year, which corresponds to a Value of a Life Year (VOLY) that is approximately 41 000 (sic).

It is likely that individuals living in the same area are exposed to the same level of air pollution, and accordingly these individuals’ valuations of a reduction may be correlated. Thus, the data have a hierarchical structure with individuals clustered within regions, and this structure violates the general assumption of independence among observations. Multilevel models allow for this type of data structure. In this paper we analyze individuals’ stated willingness to pay in an open-ended contingent valuation survey for a reduction in the local level of air pollution in Sweden. The results suggest that most variations are among individuals. However, our results indicate that there are also variations at higher levels, which may be explained by homogeneous preferences for a reduction in air pollution among individuals living in the same household or region with a similar level of air pollution. © 2001, Springer Japan.",Air pollution; Contingent valuation; Multilevel models,,,Scopus,"Willingness to pay for reduction in air pollution: a multilevel analysis This paper presents the multilevel model approach to analyzing contingent valuation surveys of individuals’ willingness to pay for reductions in the level of air pollution.

While much research has historically focused on outdoor air pollution, indoor air pollution has been relatively under-explored despite its strong connection with health outcomes, particularly respiratory health. Studies on air pollution exposure mitigation consistently reveal a significant knowledge gap between the understanding of air pollution as a health risk among lay individuals and expert scientists. This study aimed to assess how people define and understand the concept of ‘clean air’ within their home setting. Methods: We adopted a mixed-methods approach which used a guided questionnaire designed to elicit both quantitative and qualitative data, collected as digital voice notes. The total sample (n = 40) comprised data from two socially different sites of science and non-science events. We compared whether the notion of clean air inside homes differs between these two different social contexts and how views and ‘sense’ of indoor air pollution are formed. The concept of ‘place’ facilitated fluidity in our explorative analysis. Insights allowed us to assess the extent to which context mediates individuals’ perceptions of indoor air pollution and attitudes towards health risk. Results: We found that individuals’ insights were embodied in repetitive day-to-day activities (e.g. cleaning and cooking). Three key themes emerged (1) Stimulative Effects, (2) Contextual Conditions, and (3) Risk Attitudes. Sensory perceptions such as sight, smell and temperature primarily motivated participants to assess air quality inside their homes. These perceptions were shaped by contextual conditions, influencing how individuals perceived their health risk and were subsequently motivated to spend personal time considering or seeking information about household air pollution, or improving their home air quality. Conclusions: Our insights revealed that social, geographical, and contextual factors play a crucial role in individuals’ understandings of indoor air pollution. These dimensions should be integrated into designs of effective public health risk communication strategies. Our findings highlight that common lay perceptions and practices intended to improve air quality may pose health risks.

The low-idle emissions data from these surveys show that 10 percent of the fleet are responsible for about 60 percent of the exhaust hydrocarbons and also that 10 percent of the fleet (not necessarily the same vehicles) are responsible for about 60 percent of the carbon monoxide emissions. We also show that high emitters appear among all model years, and not just among old vehicles, as previously assumed. Old vehicles, on average, have higher idle emissions than new vehicles, but they contribute relatively little to the total idle emissions because there are so few on the road. We compare roadside survey results at I/M and non-l/M locations in California, and observe identical tampering and overall failure rates at the two types of locations. We also show that motorists are taking steps to “pass the test,” and that the high-emitting vehicles' idle-emissions performance and tampering rates in the roadside surveys are unaffected by the Smog Check test. These results imply that success in California's Smog Check program in reducing emissions will require consideration of human behavior and the attendant negative incentives inherent in the program as historically conceived. EPA's national tampering surveys also show little difference in tampering rates among areas with decentralized, centralized and no I/M programs. We therefore propose that an I/M “Shootout” be conducted to evaluate candidate programs for the next generation of I/M programs in the United States. © Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",,carbon monoxide; roadside survey; smog check program; traffic; vehicle emission; air pollution control; behavior; exhaust gas; law enforcement; motor vehicle; priority journal; review; smog; United States,,Scopus,"“Passing the test” – human behavior and california’s smog check program We have analyzed data obtained from more than 11,000 vehicles inspected in California's random roadside surveys to assess the realworld characteristics of the in-use motor vehicle fleet and to test the effectiveness of California's inspection and maintenance (I/M) program. The low-idle emissions data from these surveys show that 10 percent of the fleet are responsible for about 60 percent of the exhaust hydrocarbons and also that 10 percent of the fleet (not necessarily the same vehicles) are responsible for about 60 percent of the carbon monoxide emissions. We also show that high emitters appear among all model years, and not just among old vehicles, as previously assumed.
